# classification

We grouped classification datasets as `binary` and `multi-label`. `Screening-classification` datasets are also public ones 
that have either a single or multiple predicates (filters) to classify text-based tasks. We keep a link for `screening-classification` datasets that directs you to another repo of us. For the `binary-classification` and `multi-label-classification` folders, we will be providing a unique type of csv files that are ready to be processed.
