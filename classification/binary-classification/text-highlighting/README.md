This folder contains the datasets used in the paper

Ram√≠rez, J.; Baez, M.; Casati, F.; and Benatallah, B. 2019. **Understanding the impact of text highlighting in crowdsourcing tasks**. In Proceedings of the Seventh AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing, HCOMP 2019.

In a nutshell, the datasets represent two kinds of tasks:

- classification tasks with highlighting support.
- highlighting tasks, where the workers highlight evidence.


## classification tasks

In this task, workers classified documents based on a given predicate.
