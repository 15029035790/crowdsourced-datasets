42,Amazon,,"Phillip Bobbitt has created something very rare in the realm of International Relations: an entirely unique new idea.  For those students of history and current events who have grown accustomed to the accepted world views: Realism, Idealism - internationalism vs. isolationism; this new entry will provide a welcome and refreshing perspective.Rather than defining international politics in the typical framework of the ""balance of power"", or that of a ""bipolar"" or ""mulitpolar"" world, Bobbitt has completely redefined the course of history with his thesis.  He states the modern state has evolved through the course of history and taken many different forms, based on the demands and interplay (or history) of Strategy and Constitutional development.These various forms of the state have had differing expectations demanded from their populaces, and differing relationships amongst themselves at the international level.  Based on a field relationship between Strategy and Constitutionalism, different forms of the state have proven dominant at different periods of time.  Developments in one arena will create new trends in another- and the interplay is constant.  Currently Bobbitt makes the case that the current incarnation of the modern state, the Nation-State, is giving way to a new form which he has named the Market-State.Bobbitt backs up his arguments well with an historical analysis of the modern state ranging from the Machiavellian Princely-State to the wars of the Nation-States and beyond.  The entire book is very well documented with Primary and Secondary sources, which are indexed and included in a comprehensive bibliography.There is also a very interesting section written on the ""Possible Worlds"" of tomorrow based on the ground rules laid down throughout the book.  So Bobbitt not only comments on our past and present, but continues with speculation and predictions on the near term future.  This gives the ""Shield"" very well rounded experience for its contemporary reader.  What will be interesting is if this section stands the test of time.  I also hope that Mr. Bobbitt comments on his theses in future editions and expands this particular section as history progresses.The book is Mammoth, and would require a mammoth review to do it justice.  So at the expense of thoroughness, and to save you a few minutes I will say this: ""The Shield of Achilles"" is a long read well worth your time and its arguments should be considered by any students or participants in the field of International Relations",long,2527,396,neutral,neutral,good,"Phillip Bobbitt has created something very rare in the realm of International Relations : an entirely unique new idea .<q>Currently Bobbitt makes the case that the current incarnation of the modern state , the Nation-State , is giving way to a new form which he has named the Market-State.Bobbitt backs up his arguments well with an historical analysis of the modern state ranging from the Machiavellian Princely-State to the wars of the Nation-States and beyond .<q>Based on a field relationship between Strategy and Constitutionalism , different forms of the state have proven dominant at different periods of time .","Phillip Bobbitt has created something very rare in the realm of International Relations : an entirely unique new idea .

45,Amazon,,"Written half a century ago, this well-researched historical fiction is as vibrant and as stirring today, as it, undoubtedly, was when it was first written. A best seller in its day, the book regales the reader with the story of Katherine De Roet and John of Gaunt. Born commoners to a herald who was knighted before he died, Katherine and her older sister Philippa, who went on to marry Geoffrey Chaucer, were left poor as church mice. While Philippa managed to obtain a post in the household of the Queen, wife to King Edward III of England, Katherine was sent to a convent. When she had grown into her early teens and become a raving beauty, Katherine left the convent to join her sister at Court. Upon doing so, her youthful beauty captivated a boorish knight, Sir Hugh Swynford, who lusted after her. He eventually married Katherine, when it became clear that it would be the only way by which he could satisfy his desire. At the same time that she met her husband to be, she also caught the eye of John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, son of King Edward III and brother to the heir to the throne, Edward, the Black Prince. John was, at the time, happily married to a beautiful woman named Blanche, who would befriend Katherine. After reluctantly becoming Lady Swynford, Katherine retired to her husband's estates. She would meet John of Gaunt again, igniting a passion that upon the death of Blanche and that of Sir Hugh Swynford would be consummated. For John of Gaunt, Katherine would remain the love of his life and his mistress, even though, for reasons of state, he could not marry her, at the time. He, instead, married the heiress to the throne of Castile. Still, Katherine remained with him, bearing him many children. Their illicit union was to cause much unrest and scandal throughout England, until they finally parted, only to reunite in their later years. John of Gaunt would then do something unprecedented. This act would bring them much happiness in their final years. This is a richly drawn portrait of a scintillating love affair in a time that was rife with political intrigue. Set in a medieval landscape with all the pageantry, strife, and turbulence that constituted fourteenth century England, this beautifully written narrative is peppered with those characters and individuals that made the period memorable. It is a novel to be savored and one with which the most discerning reader would be well satisfied.

11,Amazon,,"Wallace Stevens is my favorite poet. This Library of America collection is to be preferred as a source of his writing: it includes a number of additional poems relative to his Collected Poems (including the controversial long poem ""Owl's Clover""), as well as alternate versions of some poems, juvenilia, and also Stevens's essays.Stevens is known, it seems to me, in two separate ways. In the popular sense, he is known for a series of remarkable early poems, in most cases not terribly long, notable for striking images and quite beautiful prosody. Of these poems the most famous is surely ""Sunday Morning"" -- other examples are ""Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird"", ""Peter Quince at the Clavier"", ""Sea Surface Full of Clouds"", ""Tea at the Palaz of Hoon"", ""The Emperor of Ice Cream"", ""The Idea of Order at Key West"", ""Of Modern Poetry"". The great bulk of these come from his first collection, Harmonium, and indeed from the first edition of Harmonium, published in 1923. These were certainly my favorite among his poems on first reading. And they remain favorites.But his critical reputation rests strikingly on a completely different set of poems, all later than those mentioned above. (Though it must be acknowledged that at least ""Sunday Morning"" and ""The Idea of Order at Key West"" as well as two early long poems, ""The Comedian as the Letter C"" and ""The Monocle de Mon Oncle"", are in general highly regarded critically. And that most of his early work is certainly treated with respect.) I think it's fair to say that ""late Stevens"" begins with ""Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction"", perhaps his most highly regarded work. Of course the terms ""late"" and ""early"" are odd applied to Stevens. His first successful poems appeared in 1915 (including ""Sunday Morning""), when he was 36. He was 44 when the first edition of Harmonium came out. That's pretty late for ""early""! And by the 1942 publication of ""Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction"" he was 63. Indeed, his production from 1942 through his death in 1955 was remarkable: two major collections each with several long poems as well as at least another full collection worth of late poems, some included in this _Collected Poems_ but quite a few more not collected until after his death. What to say about late Stevens? The most obvious adjective is ""austere"". But that doesn't always apply -- he could also be quite playful. However, there is never the lushness of a ""Sunday Morning"" or ""Sea Surface Full of Clouds"" in the late works. The sentences tend to extraordinary length, but the internal rhythms are involving. The poems are all quite philosophical, much concerned with the importance of poetry, the nature of reality versus perceptions of reality, and, perhaps more simply, with growing old. (A Stevens theme, to be sure, that can be traced at least back to ""The Monocle de Mon Oncle"".)So: Stevens is an impossibly wonderful, remarkable, poet, either early or late. His lush and imagist early work remains a delight, and his philosophically involving late work rewards rereading and concentration.

17,Amazon,,"I've vaguely liked the Avengers in the past, having been a fan going all the way back to the John Buscema days. But even in the Buscema era, there was always this sense of ho-humness to it all, a staid sameness to the stories, a lack of spark. None of the Avengers members made me sit up and take notice...they all bored me... Captain America, Iron Man, the Wasp, Thor, Hercules, the Vision, Firefox...*yawn*. It was evident to me that complacency had become the standard of the day. It  finally forced  me to withdraw my half-hearted patronship. Even Busiek and the awesome George Perez's run couldn't enlist me to the fold. Bendis signing on with the title in 2004 didn't do it either. But with the New Avengers, Brian Michael Bendis seems to finally have hit on that magic formula that I think'll bring about the most successful Avengers run yet. Okay, here's a quick plot break-down: The New Avengers #1 (trade paperback) opens up in a Marvel universe where the Avengers team has been disbanded (see Avengers Disassembled). There is a massive breakout at Ryker's Island and 87 supervillains run amok. Unfortunately for them, Daredevil, Spider-Woman and Luke Cage (with Foggy Nelson) were already on site, visiting the self-incarcerated Sentry. Captain America, Iron Man and Spidey show up soon after. There is a super-melee and then order is restored, but not after the damage is done.  45 supercriminals are re-jailed, but 42 escape (from Iron Man: ""Okay, we officially did that half-ass.""). Captain America can't help but feel that this fortuitous meeting of heroes is an auspicious sign, that perhaps it's time again for an Avengers team to be assembled. And that's pretty much how it starts, folks.The spark that I felt was lacking in the earlier Avengers incarnations is strictly in place here. Chemistry is a palpable, exciting thing when present, and the make-up of this team lends to just such a feeling. I'm pumped up about so many things re this title. Yeah, I find Cap still boring (I don't much like Superman, either; there's just something blah about boy scouts: they're always right and goody-goody *yech!*; who can live up to that standard? how do you relate to them?) and Sentry is too powerful for my taste, but Iron Man as the co-leader is growing on me. I've always liked Spider-Woman; her current personal storyline is intriguing. Wolverine's brunt, brash attitude clashes nicely with the more sedate personalities, so that's fun. Luke Cage is very good counter-programming; he's the last person I would've thought would be an Avenger, a very anti-establishment pick. There's also a mystery member yet to show, so keep your eyes open.And finally, there's Spidey - now who woulda thunk that? With his entry in the hallowed ranks of the Avengers, he just entered full adulthood in my eyes. He's actually the main reason I decided to try this book out. Peter Parker adds humor, youth and a certain naivete that enables the reader to better relate to him and the mighty Avengers. To me, Peter is the humanizing element in this team, makes me root for the group as a whole to succeed. Also, his sense of humor seems to be influencing his teammates, who are more loose, relaxed and would occasionally even crack their own quips (even Cap now jokes around!). Peter's exchanges with Luke and Jessica are priceless.With Bendis' superb storytelling skills and Finch's awesome art, coupled with a vibrant new cast that might make you initially say ""huh?"", but will nevertheless grow on you, you cannot go wrong with the New Avengers.

35,Amazon,,"This books stands apart in autobiographies. Unlike autobiographies written in vanity at the crest of success, this one is written as a melancholic meditation on life, at the crest of what Henry Adams thought was his failure. Adams always refers to himself in third person and in the humorous and abject epithets giving the autobiography the character of a novel or a biography.Henry Adams, was a historian, journalist and political private secretary, with intrests as varied as physics, chemistry, geology, evolution, mathematics, politics, history, and diplomacy. He was the son of a diplomat, Charles Francis Adams. His grand-father was John Quincy Adams the 6th president of USA and great-grand father was John Adams, the 2nd president.Despite being one of the greatest American historians, with a successful career in history, journalism and literature, Adams regarded himself as a failure because he was inconsequential in politics and society as compared to his forefathers and his education based on eighteenth century principles of the founding fathers of USA, imparted through his relatives, peers, school, socity and the Harvard College, was unsuitable to meet the challenges of the world he was to grow into - the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.Adams believed that the law of acceleration of forces in history lead to a situation where a person trained for a certain level of complexity finds himself at the mercy of forces of a higher complexity as he grows up. This was his theory of history, intimately derived from his experience of life.He felt that all education through parents, school, college, work or life can never in its entirety prepare a person for life, because the society around you changes at an accelerating pace while your education rooted in your parents values and the value of the soceity of your childhood becomes obsolete by the time you need to put it to use. So at each stage of life man always needs to begin his education anew.The merit of this books goes beyond just and insight into education, life or failure. It also illuminates the time from 1838 to 1905.

1,Amazon,,"I have purchased about forty books that deal with warfare in antiquity in the past year.  Almost all of them have proven to be utterly infuriating and completely useless.  You can garner from the Internet every iota of information that you can from just about all the books offered on ancient warfare.  Most deal more with societal effects, cultural developments and histories of civilizations than they do with battlefield strategies, tactics and how men actually used their weapons in the thick of combat.  These books are, for the most part, completely useless and should be avoided.Except this one.The Western War of War is a triumph of analysis in both the microscopic makeup of a hoplite army and the experiences they underwent during a battle.  In my research I have found THIS BOOK alone to be a gem, an unparalleled necessity to discern what Greek warfare was truly like.  The author pulls quotes from Herodotus, Homer, Xenophon and others to illustrate his excellent insights into the entire process of hoplite fighting.  If you buy this book you will learn what kind of men donned the aspis shield and bronze cuirass; what it was like to use the ash or cornel wood spear and the xyphos sword; what an army did from the moment they rose to the seconds before the clash; the spacing and makeup of troops; the infurating conflict and the confusion of battle; what it smelled, tasted, sounded and felt like to be lost in the miasma of two phalanxes grinding against one another.  On top of this you will read about examples of ancient battles and how they illustrate Mr. Hanson's insights further.The only gripe anyone could have with this book is that there are no pictures to go along wit the text, but the descriptions are so in-depth that no visuals are needed, the author's words paint a vivid picture worthy of a novel.  You will not be disappointed by the lack of pictures or diagrams, this book conveys its subject perfectly.Go used if you can (as always), but don't shy away from having to pay retail.

27,Amazon,,"There's an elephant in the room which I need to address. If you took  a look at the Publishers Weekly review, you know what I mean. Quite the coup for a first-time novelist from a Christian publishing house to receive such notice. Except for the part of the review that delivers some tough criticism. Here's probably the harshest line: ""the series of misunderstandings that she [the protagonist] substitutes for actual problems give the novel a contrived feel""Don't get me wrong--I respect PW and know that their approval (which they end up giving Chocolate Beach in small doses) can mean a lot to the success of a novel. However, they are not infallible. In this instance, they got it wrong. Not totally. But still wrong.Yes, protagonist Brianna Stone does seem to have an ideal life. I thought it sounded about perfect and sort of smiled when she found her day at her beach home with her one son and lawyer husband so exhausting she needed to take a nap. But Bri's worries are not based on misunderstandings, as PW suggests. Nor does the one comment from her friend send her off doing drastic things to her lifestyle.Instead, a sequence of events, one after the other, expose a problem at her core--a problem she handles badly. All of these circumstances taken together work powerfully to teach Bri what change she really needs to make. Which is the way I see God so often working in my life.Strengths. There are many. For one, I agree with PW that Carobini's ""descriptions of characters and events are often witty and engaging."" The book was fun, humorous, yes, witty.Carobini also has such a strong, fresh voice and has the knack of making each of her characters unique and interesting. Bri, of course, is the strongest. She is a likable protagonist, convincing--someone I found myself caring for, worrying with. Her jaunty tone contrasted with several of the uptight women in her life, setting her apart in a positive way.The story is delightful--the unexpected and worrisome mixed with the humorous. Carobini sprinkles the story liberally with pop-culture allusions that add an interesting dimension. Plus, I found the events believable, especially as backstory was layered in.No, some of the deep hurts of Bri's past do not become the focus of the story, nor should they in a mom-lit story. What does happen is the realization of a new way to handle hurts.Which brings me to the theme of the story. * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * If I had to spell it out, I'd use lines straight from the book--not because Carobini preached, but because her character discovered what she needed to know: ""Not that I don't believe there's power in transformation. Oh, I do, I do! I think, though, that it should start with the mind and the heart, not rumors and fears.""It seems to me the PW reviewer missed this point in stating that the story was built upon misunderstandings. It was not. It was built on Bri's doubts and fears, all well established throughout the story, but not belabored. After all, this is mom-lit. * * * End SPOILER ALERT * * *Weakness. As I've already mentioned, in the beginning I had a little bit of a desire to head-slap Bri for not drinking in her perfect life. Of course, that was because as I first viewed her life, it looked quite appealing, something I wouldn't mind too much if I were forced to take her place.But as I began to see her life as she saw it, to understand that she had good reasons for her concerns, my empathy for her grew and my belief in the rightness of her reactions cancelled out those early inclinations.Recommendation. I enjoyed this book immensely, even though it is not my genre of choice. It was fun to read and the character stayed on my mind for days after. I was sorry I didn't have some way of checking in on Bri to see how she is doing now.

18,Amazon,,"Grentz's Primer is singled out by the articles in Reclaiming the Center because it is an important contribution to formulating a coherent view of postmodern thought; however, the direction that Grentz suggests in his conclusion is well-intentioned but misguided. A survey of recent intellectual thought within the Christian church shows the Grentz is within the missionary tradition of the church: he embraces certain aspects of postmodernism in order to reach postmoderns. The same desire gave rise to liberalism at the beginning of the last century: to reach adherents of enlightenment rationalism the gospel needed to accommodate itself to an intellectual world in which rational man was the center. Toward the middle of the twentieth century, neo-orthodoxy sought to communicate the gospel to existential man through a program of demythologizing the gospel, and form and redaction criticism. Likewise, Grentz seeks to convert postmodern individuals to Christianity by framing the gospel in postmodern terms. Like earlier attempts to convert people through by accommodating the message, there is a reaction. Some will embrace Grentz's program as a means of reaching the unchurched. Others, like the contributors to Reclaiming the Center, will reject Grentz's proposal as an unacceptable accommodation.The fundamental question is whether postmodernism is compatible with historic Christianity. I do not believe that it is. First, Christianity makes universal truth claims. Jean Francois Leotard, the most famous European postmodern, in The Postmodern Condition defined postmodernism as ""incredulity toward meta-narratives"" because meta-narratives promise but cannot deliver. Christianity, like all philosophical systems, is a meta-narrative (cf. 1 Cor. 15; John 14:6f., 8:31f., 1:1ff., etc.). The gospel is a target for postmodern deconstruction because these truth claims are total and exclusive. Second, the Bible is a text that purports to be the word of God. Jesus said, ""Thy word is truth"" (John 17:17). For postmoderns, the authorial intent is impossible to assertain (contra E. D. Hirsch, Validity in Interpretation). And if intent could be assertained, it should be deconstructed because it is necessarily oppressive. Furthermore, if ""every scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the person dedicated to God may be capable and equipped for every good work"" (2 Tim. 3:16f.), then the subtext of scripture is oppressive. Postmoderns feel the need to deconstruct these oppressive elements to become liberators of a radical (Nietzschean) kind. Third, from its inception to the present, Christianity is fundamentally a belief system that can be expressed propositionally. The scriptures contain propositions or statements that can readily be transformed into truth claims. The historic doctrines and creeds for Christendom are expressed propositionally. Postmodernism rejects the validity of such claims. They are the social products of communities rather than discovered or disclosed truth. Grentz's evangelistic zeal leads him to seek accommodation with a school of thought that is antagonistic with what he holds most dear",long,3214,475,neutral,suboptimal,suboptimal,"A survey of recent intellectual thought within the Christian church shows the Grentz is within the missionary tradition of the church : he embraces certain aspects of postmodernism in order to reach postmoderns .<q>Likewise , Grentz seeks to convert postmodern individuals to Christianity by framing the gospel in postmodern terms .<q>Some will embrace Grentz 's program as a means of reaching the unchurched .","Grentz 's Primer is singled out by the articles in Reclaiming the Center because it is an important contribution to formulating a coherent view of postmodern thought ; however , the direction that Grentz suggests in his conclusion is well-intentioned but misguided .

14,Amazon,,"    This book is the best book I have ever read. It brought me shivers, heartache, guilt, love towards others. It made me realize how people are in the world, and how all of these wonderful gifts appear to us in mystery, love and by prayer. You yourself have to believe and look around to what you have been given in life.     If you are a nonbeliever of God, Jesus, and the angels, you seriously need to read this book and repent your sins, ask God for forgiveness and ask Him into your heart. It's a story about a women (the author who wrote this book) going into Hell first for ten days and then arriving into Heaven with the angel of God and Jesus Himself. Jesus would come and appear in her bedroom around two in the morning and take her up to heaven. Jesus picked her and told her that she was supposed to tell everyone else back on earth about what she saw. She was completely speechless when she arrived.     Jesus and the angel of God took her to many rooms and explained each and every room to her and what they do in there. One room that was one of my favorites was the room of tears. It was a room filled with bottles of water that were actually filled with human tears back on earth. She witnessed an angel coming back from the earth carrying a bowl of a man's tears. The angel set it down on the most beautiful table. He took one single tear drop and dropped it on a empty book that he was holding. The women saw that empty book with empty pages appear into words just with that one tear drop. I'm not sure what it was saying but I think that it would be the prayers that that man has said while crying or just about his life.     Mary (the author who witnessed this experience) saw an angel holding The Book Of Life. If some of you who don't know what that is, it is a book with names of people who are going to heaven, so if your name is not in that book, you're not going to heaven. Satan has a book he calls The Black Book and your name does not want to be in there or else you are in big trouble. To be in God's book you have to be born again, ask Him in your heart and repent your sins (which means ask for forgiveness and mean it).    I can't tell you what happens in the end, but what I can tell you is that all through that book Mary kept saying, ""God is real, Jesus is real, Heaven is real, please believe in this place."" She sang songs up there, praised to Him and everyone is happy. She also realized that when she was in Hell she noticed that there were no babies or infants there, so if any mothers out there who have lost a child I am glad to tell you that He or She is in heaven with God and is very happy.

12,Amazon,,"I just received this fantastic James Bond poster collection book and I have to say, this is indispensable stuff, going all the way from Dr NO to Die Another Day, and even including oddities like Casino Royale and Never Say Never Again. Author Tony Nourmand has clearly put a great amount of effort and research into the making of this book, and it shows. Beautifully presented, this has quickly turned out to be one of my preferred movie books. Showcasing classic posters from some of the leading graphic artists of the 1970s and 80s like Robert McGinnis (Live and Let Die and The Man with The Golden Gun are amazing), Bob Peak (Moonraker), Frank McCarthy, Renato Casaro and Randi Braun, their collective works culminate in a lavishly presented masterwork that looks fantastic. Footnotes on subtle changes that were made to some late 70s movie posters are particularly welcome, as are the informative and interesting introductions that accompany the film-based chapters. The Sean Connery films for instance, comprise extensive thoughts from Nourmand talking about discarded poster ideas and how the change of leading man from Connery to George Lazenby caused some marketing concerns. It's not difficult to see why some of the early posters like From Russia With Love are sought after by collectors, these highly prized masterpieces are worth thousands by today's market. Being a poster collector myself, I've found that this is a particularly lucrative hobby. Theses are not just your average, run of the mill images, these are works of art that look beautiful on the wall. Poster layouts for the Roger Moore era are the most elaborate, indicating the change in times, Britain and America's quickly changing tastes, and the myriad of factors that are involved in this particular art. Foreign posters from Japan and Spain display the differential takes on how these particular films should be marketed, and the changes that were made by more conservative global regions to the more sexually suggestive artwork. Reading it, one notices the gradual change from traditional watercolor artwork to photo mosaics and stylish computer-aided photography. Which is, arguably less impressive, but mostly, the posters for the new Pierce Brosnan films do carry on the subtle nuances and certain recognizable M.O that is so popular.

36,Amazon,,"This is an easy-to-read yet entertaining and intelligent book to introduce the newcomer to the major composers and musical works of classical music.  It is valuable for learing the background of the music and composer as well as a few 'technical things' about the music itself.  It is ideal to start one's study with such major works as these since they often were the pioneering compositions that brought forth the new ideas, defined styles and ushered in the transition into the next musical era (eg: Baroque to Classical eras). The author conveniently breaks down the vast world of classical music into the basic genres: orchestral works, concertos, chamber works, solo piano, opera & choral - but gives much more treatment to the first two categories.There are many guides to classical music/recordings and each has its strengths as well as gaps.  This one has a nice balance of history, musical score ""analysis"" and discussion of a couple recommended recordings of the selections the author considers a ""major work.""  as such, it allows one to identify the most significant works of classical music and build a small, high-quality collection.  I find Mr. Libbey's CD recommendations wuite reliable overall but perhaps not as up-to-date given the 1999 publication date.  Additionally, this book is a great bargin (especially used).Best of all The NRP Guide is non-intimidating and well written in a way that pulls you into the (often foreign and intimidating) world of these composers and their music, giving many fun and fascinating antidotes and trinkets of knowledge - without musical jargon or dull academic prose.  Of course it will not cover all of one's favorite works or composers,  but no one book can (some reviewers below seem to expect EVERY favorite work in such a brief guide).  Over 2/3 of the book is dedicated to orchestral and concerto music (the author's obvious favorites given his ""Top 40"" list contains mostly all symphonies).  Consequently, as another reviewer mentions, this guide shortchanges the latter sections on opera, solo piano and chamber music.  This is unfortunate, but not all is lost as what is here is quite good.  Specifically, Libbey gives a fine introduction to Beethoven's most-famous ""name sonatas"" like the ""Pathetique,"" ""Moonlight,"" ""Waldstein,"" and the ""Appasionata"" - which should be of great interest to most readers.  If you really are into chamber music or solo piano, you might then supplement this NPR Guide with the fabulous and inexpensive ""Guide to Chamber Music"" and/or ""Guide to the Sonatas"" by Melvin Berger - two books that allow the layman to easily follow along with the music and its historical context.  If your main interest is opera, look elsewhere as there is not much here.Two other similar and excellent reference books to the classics overall I would recommend are: (1) ""Essential Cannon of Classical Music"" by music scholar David Dubal and (2) ""The Rough Guide to Classical Music."" Dubal's book is definately a notch higher in terms of depth of coverage and musicology including insightful reviews of the major musical eras (Baroque, Classical, Romantic) and compelling, in-depth biographies of the great composers.  The 2005 ""Rough Guide to Classical Music"" is also an excellent choice with a beautiful color layout and excellent, up-to-date recording recommendations (and rationale for those choices which I liked).  If you don't have any guide to classical music and are getting frustrated sorting out all the choices, why not just get this one and go from there?

28,Amazon,,"Please do not listen to the other review of this book: it is clearly written by someone who hasn't read Glynn's carefully argued, very interesting examination of ""trash"" television. ""John Q. Public,"" as he calls himself in the review, seems to make it sound so simple -- networks play things because they get ratings. But what Glynn answers in a way that all of John Q's love for PBS can't is WHY they get ratings. The answer to this question has so often been astoundingly shortsighted and downright insulting: ""People watch trash TV because they're stupid, don't know any better, and never will"" or something as asinine and simplistic as that.But Glynn digs into the populist in a very interesting way, and what he finds is that these shows frequently validate everyday experiences and knowledge of everyday, working class viewers in ways that many instances of ""high culture"" on television don't. Glynn's point is not at all about aesthetics or artistic value (as John Q. Public assumes, having not read the book, that it is), as he largely leaves this question for the reader to answer: his point is about not just disregarding all these programs AND all their viewers because one has made such artistic judgements. In ""trash"" TV, Glynn finds many democratic tendencies.At times, Glynn can overdo it, and at other times, his enthusiasm to defend overlooks, or rushes through, disturbing political content of the shows (such as inherent racism or sexism), but most of the time he is remarkably careful to balance such tensions.This is an academic text, and so may not be ideal for everyone, though it is reasonably accessible. So, if you want to go beyond complaining that such television shouldn't exist, and if you're actually interested in why it does, and why so many people turn to it, I highly recommend this book. I share the reviewer ""John Q Public's"" regard for PBS, though I feel it has turned its back on many Americans, and on the real John Q Publics, so to speak.

41,Amazon,,"I've read about a dozen introductory books on philosophy and this is hands down the best. My only regret is that I did not find this book sooner - it would have saved me a lot of time. Rigorous and thorough (almost to a fault), this book demands a large investment of your time, energy and concentration, but it will be worth it.Part I: Skim this. The 'What is Philosophy' discussions are more rewarding for people who already know some philosophy. And the section on logic is just too difficult of a subject to summarize, I fear it will discourage many readers. I've already read a couple books on philosophical logic and I found this section intimidating. If you do want an accessible introduction to logic, I recommend 'An Introduction to Logic' by Harry Gensler. Download the logicola software and do the exercises.Parts II and III: In my opinion, these are the heart of the book. Work hard on these sections and take good notes for the sake of your comprehension. The authors present the best comparison of the correspondence versus the coherence theories of truth I've seen, as well as a great introduction to Alvin Plantinga's reformed epistemology. The section on metaphysics is equally strong, particularly their discussion of ontology, which I'd always found confusing in the past. They swayed me from nominalism to realism. The discussion of dualism is not quite as strong, I'm still on the fence as to whether I subscribe to the majority Christian view in support of dualism.Part V: An excellent but demanding primer on ethical systems. For those who want a gentler introduction I would recommend 'Ethics: a Contemporary Introduction' by Harry Gensler. 'Moral Theory' by David Oderberg is an excellent defense of natural rights ethics.Part VI: You would expect compelling arguments for the existence of God by two Christians known for winning debates with atheists, and the book does not disappoint. The section on the Kalam cosmological argument is characteristically thorough but probably does not have much new material for people already familiar with William Lane Craig's work. I was particularly impressed by the discussion of the teleological argument. it is the most compelling summary that I have seen, and it also includes a quick refutation of inflationary theory's ability to explain away cosmic coincidences.This is a demanding book and it might be overwhelming for your first pass through philosophy. I would recommend starting with 'An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis' by John Hospers. It is biased towards atheism, but Christians should still read it to benefit from its high quality explanation (the reverse applies to atheists thinking about buying this book). Finally, 'Modern Philosophy' is a superb survey of contemporary philosophy, and 'An Introduction to Logic' by Harry Gensler is a great for self-study on logic due to the logicola software that accompanies the book. Another nice feature is that it aplies logical principles to ethics and concludes with a proof of a sophisticated version of the Golden Rule in formal logic",long,3069,500,neutral,suboptimal,good,"If you do want an accessible introduction to logic , I recommend 'An Introduction to Logic ' by Harry Gensler .<q>The authors present the best comparison of the correspondence versus the coherence theories of truth I 've seen , as well as a great introduction to Alvin Plantinga 's reformed epistemology .<q>And the section on logic is just too difficult of a subject to summarize , I fear it will discourage many readers .","And the section on logic is just too difficult of a subject to summarize , I fear it will discourage many readers .

He has compiled here a magnificent volume of Gen X African American writers who are intelligent and thought provoking.   Where do I start? Well for one I have to disagree with the previous reviewer about Powell's anger.  I think the introduction was a prelude to the rest of the great writing.  Angry?  I think not.  He's just keeping it real.  That said, this book is not just Kevin Powell, though he does have a moving essay that I read a few years ago in VIBE- &quot;Live From Death Row&quot; which gives the background of the label of Tupac Shakur, among others.   There is other hip-hop journalism from Joan Morgan and Farai Chideya, two of my favorites.  Scott-Poulson-Bryant's view of Puff Daddy in &quot;This is Not a Puff Piece&quot; is illuminating.

20,Amazon,,"This is almost two books in one. The first book is just in the pictures, reproductions of paintings, photos, and even a few cartoons that celebrate the figure. The pictorial reading is hugely informative by itself. The authors place each picture in the historical or visual context that led up to it - showing related pictures that might have informed the one being discussed, or displaying cartoons that editorialize on the figure in then-contemporary art. One thing that's hard for a modern viewer is to see the pictures through Victorian eyes, with Victorian sensibilities. Nudity often represented innocence, invoking Edenic times before modesty (and immodesty, by implication) arose. This seems true, most often, when depicting youths and children. A modern viewer is free to wonder, though - weren't a few artists, Charles Dodgson included, just a bit shrill in protesting their innocent motives? The second reading of this book is in its explanatory text, an even partner with the imagery itself. This is what a picture book's text should be, but too rarely is. It really does add insight to the images. Sometimes the writing explains mythical references that are now obscure, sometimes it describes the artist and that artist's place in society, sometimes it explains how competing schools of thought created pictures with specific features of style. In every case, though, the reading is worthwhile, if only because it invites the reader to linger just a little longer over each of the pictures shown.The artists represented here all honor classical human beauty in its many forms, male, female, and child. That explains one of two lacks I found in this book. First was the absence of mature figures, especially among the women. It was and often still is implicit that only the young can be beautiful. This error deprives fully adult women of their due, and deprives the viewer of a wider vision of human wonder. Second, this book emphasizes the classical, formal style of painting. I miss the other kinds of images that were also being made at the time, especially the Impressionist. The first lack I attribute to the artists of the time, but the second was introduced by the modern editors. It's a minor point, though, and does not interfere with the enjoyment of what is present.This is a book worth having and keeping, for its inherent beauty, for its intelligent commentary, and for its presentation of painters I might not have known otherwise. //wiredweir",long,2471,409,good,good,good,"The first book is just in the pictures , reproductions of paintings , photos , and even a few cartoons that celebrate the figure .<q>One thing that 's hard for a modern viewer is to see the pictures through Victorian eyes , with Victorian sensibilities .<q>This is almost two books in one .","The first book is just in the pictures , reproductions of paintings , photos , and even a few cartoons that celebrate the figure .

2,Amazon,," When people describe Batman and any related character, a prevailing word is dark. Well, what exactly is dark when it comes to a psychotic billionaire with three dimensional villains? Grant Morrison answers this question and offers a brilliant take inside Gotham's Dark Knight. Respectively named, Arkham Asylum takes the reader into a psychological journey using myth, symbol, and powerful dialog that will surely make this buy an unforgettable read. Coupled with Dave McKean of The Wolves of the Walls fame whose art evokes surrealism and an otherwordly nightmarish atmosphere that perfectly compliments Grant Morrison's wizardly writing. When I first ordered Arkham Asylum, it was my first reintroduction to the Bat. Forget Paul Dini and Bruce Timm's dark film noir of Batman the animated series. Forget the 1989 blockbuster which propelled AA's sales. Not even last year's Batman Begins could do this dark twisted novel justice. This is the Batman that makes the Adam West version look like the Teletubbies. This Batman ain't for kiddies, folks! Arkham Asylum is Ozzy Osbourne meets Aleister Crowley without slipping into shock for shock sake. I highly reccomend getting the Anniversary Edition which answers many of the questions as well as interesting inside tidbits that didn't make it to the final cut. This book shows Batman and the rogues at their most demented. A Batman out of emotional trauma stabs himself to wake up out of the surrealistic atomsphere that drained him only moments after entering Arkham, a pseudo-pedophealic Mad Hatter, and a Joker who uses crude innuendo are just some of the aspects that made this edition both a treat and a shocker to add to anyones' personal collection. One of my favorite bits in Arkham was the tragic Two Face breaching a whole new dimension of 'insanity'. The reason I highlight the word is due to this book asking it's audience 'What is exactly the meaning of the word?' Psychological thrillers offer varying nuances and takes of what makes the human mind capable of treading into the dark side. Although fiction is just that, fiction, Batman offers a probable solution to the human condition when it slips into another, socially undesirable plane: ""Sometimes it's our madness that makes us who we are.""Although this isn't a exactly a Batman vs. XYZ story, Joker does make a lasting impression on his audience. Joker was originally designed to appear in Dr. Frank N Furter gear which can be seen in thumbnails in the back of the book. His appearance is nothing short of grotesque and disturbing. The Mother theme which is prevailing throughout the book can be seen even in the Ace of Knaves who acts as a sort of Mother guide to the other rogues, and what better way to corrupt the tragic childhood image that plagues the back of Batman's mind? Whether in lingerie or not, Joker as 'Madonna' certainly came across as someone with an agenda (whatever it is at any given time), who shakes up the establishment, someone who takes the 'freak out the people' to the extreme is very reminiscent of what the Material Girl was doing at the around the same time. Morrison did a wonderful job here. Mad Hatters cameo is nothing short of chilling. The perversion of a childhood storybook character comes to life with his encounter with the Bat. Forget the Disney version!I reccomend reading this book on a dark stormy night with Black Sabbath by Black Sabbath playing in the background.

If you are well-versed in design, this is a book with infinite layers. This book sends me into create daydreams that can last for hours.  It's the visual equivalent to the experience of drifting into a thousand other places from a great line in a book.  Kelly has an incredible talent for drawing from a number of varied styles to create a space that looks as though it has been lived in, buying the best of the best and acknowledging high-brow trends, for decades. Her spaces have the feeling that they have evolved over time. Hollywood Regency has been attached to her, but she has a style that  draws most dominantly from David Hicks (they have red rooms that are nearly identical). She has clearly been a student of everything visual that she could get her hands on. She has taken instruction from the greatest designers and has been able to put a signature on her interpretation. Kelly has an incredible eye for color, pattern and detail. Her style is not as much a revival as an homage. This for me defines design right now. Look closely, there are a number of people following suit.  To see how much skill is required to achieve the elegance that Kelly does, look at the kitschiness  of Jonathan Adler's recent interior endeavors.  He has a similar sensibility, but is such a near miss.  She has an incredible eye and like all good designers can mix the expensive with the inexpensive, but don't be tricked, her rooms are chock-full of very important pieces.

49,Amazon,,"Ever since I read ""Moral Animal,"" by Wright back in 1995, and then Ridley's ""Red Queen,"" I have been a sucker for evolutionary psychology.  If you believe in evolution, it only makes sense to assume that the same natural selection that caused us to walk upright and develop big brains - also molded every nuance of our social and sexual interactions.   Now here comes Gilbert with his ""Disposable Male.""Sex isn't fair.  For a man, a brief sexual adventure can be just that - nothing more.  For a woman, it may be the beginning of a lifelong obligation.  A man's entire sexual identity may be wrapped up in repetition of this one act - not necessarily with that one female.  No wonder he's so ready to do it again.  Female mammals so consistently make the bigger parental investment, they have immensely more to lose from a casual encounter - thus opposing sexual agendas emerged.  Females learned to grant sexual privileges to the males who advertised the best long-term resources.  Men countered by misrepresenting their intentions and an evolutionary arms race of courting styles was set into motion.  As Gilbert puts it, ""faint rumblings of relationship could be heard in the distance."" This book is about how sexual agendas that evolved in a hunter-gatherer world work themselves out in modern society.  Men and women may have compatible goals and much in common, but the differences in hormones, genes, and psychosexual outlook are as different as day and night - making marriage seem like an uneasy compromise, at best.  Some would suggest that with modern methods of birth control, liberated women are now capable of being as happily promiscuous as men are (or fantasize of being).  That view has to contend with social and sexual interactions that were formed by millions of years of natural selection. Gilbert faces these dilemmas with optimism and humor.  The bonding of the sexes builds upon mutual need and strategic advantage for both partners.  It calls for compromises, yet can work.  We evolved from ancestors who lived lives of pure instinct to sophisticated beings capable of exquisite reasoning skills.  Still, ancient reptilian drives lay just beneath the surface.  Our individual happiness and the success of society depend upon how we reconcile our heritage with the demands of modern life.  Here is his bottom line:  Realizing and acknowledging our roots helps us to seek fulfilling and acceptable ways to combine our passions with the mysteries of love.  Easily 5 stars!

8,Amazon,,"At a very young age I started reading adventure stories of heroes from far away lands who performed extraordinary feats. As I grew up, history became my obsession; history in general, the middle ages in particular. I fell in love with new heroes whose exploits were as amazing as those of fiction. Then I discovered mysteries and again I couldn't have enough. So how can one author unite so brilliantly my three favorite subjects? Only when this author is Sharon Kay Penman! I entered Ms. Penman's world several years ago with one of her historical novels, and I was hooked for life. So it was only natural that when her first medieval mystery was published it would make its way into my hands. Medieval mysteries have become a popular genre, but no author masters the accuracy of the time as Ms. Penman does. I just finished reading the third installment in her series of medieval mysteries, ""Dragon's Lair"", and found myself pleasantly surprised that she could have improved on her two previous ones. ""Dragon's Lair"" takes our hero Justin de Quincy into Wales, where he must unravel the mysterious disappearance of a large portion of the ransom the Holy Roman Emperor has claimed to release King Richard from an Austrian dungeon, where he is being held captive. His younger brother John lusts after the crown and will stop at nothing to prevent his royal brother from buying his freedom and return to England. But Queen Eleanor, mother of both, will do anything in her power to free Richard, her favorite son, and return the rightful heir to the throne. David ab Owain, reigning Prince of Wales, conveniently accuses his nephew, Llewelyn ab Iorwerth, central character of Ms. Penman's second historical novel, ""Here Be Dragons"" of stealing the ransom. Taking a gamble, Justin joins forces with the rebel Welshman in an attempt to locate the stolen ransom and uncover the conspiracy. Treachery abounds in thirteenth century Wales and England. Corruption, murder, betrayal! Nothing new, but Ms. Penman makes it so fascinating to the reader that the book is impossible to put down.

47,Amazon,,"Oh, what a wonderful, living, time machine of a book.  The subject is ""daily life in 19th century England.""  More directly, the book is addressed to anyone who ever read a book by Dickens, Austen, or one of the Bronte sisters, and found themselves struggling along as best they could to grasp the importance of whist, calling cards, and the different types of carriages. I would think that if you're a fan of Victorian literature, you'll love this book, but honestly, I'm not a fan of Victorian literature, and I enjoyed it intensely.  We live in a rapidly-changing, diverse, multicultural society now, and while this certainly has its strong points, there seems to be some pleasure in reminding ourselves of the vitality and strength of English society at the height of its 19th century influence.  Somewhere underneath our current world, we subconsciously sense a shared heritage here worth remembering (and this has nothing to do with bloodlines; I'm Czech by blood, but still feel the power of a world I care about stirring back to life in this book.)It is -- for lack of a better word -- fun -- to read through these various explanations and to see this forgotten world coming back together.  How do I make change, what are shillings and pence again?  How do you play the card game, ""whist?""  What terms of address are people of different social ranks supposed to use with each other?  Why are the English eating pudding all the time in these novels?  What's the difference between a brougham and a curricle?  When am I supposed to leave my calling card, and to whom?  And what are all these dances that Elizabeth and Darcy are doing?Victorian literature allows readers to swim in this cultural landscape but never really explains it.  One just has to try to pick it all up by osmosis.  That's actually a perfectly good way to learn about a culture, but for those of us who like a little more straightforward explanation, this book fits the bill.  It's as though you took the Time Machine back to 1835, made your way along as best you could for a while, and finally someone sits you down and says, ""OK, THIS is how all this works. Use THIS spoon, and don't call Mr. So-and-so that, it's rude, etc. . . ""  The light bulb finally goes on in your head, and you feel much better.If the book simply explained all this stuff without being vivid and fun, I wouldn't give it five stars.

23,Amazon,,"This book is an exploration into all aspects of ant life, written for general readers.  Holldobler and Wilson, who wrote the massive scientific reference volume, The Ants, felt that there was also a demand for a less formal book about ants that ordinary readers might enjoy reading from cover-to-cover.  In this book, they describe not only the lives of ants and ant colonies, but also how their own interests in ants developed.  The book covers such topics as the dominance of ants, the life and death of the colony, the colony as a superorganism, ant communication, relations between ants within and between colonies, ancient ants, ant parasites, army ants, and ants and the environment.  They also include a brief section on how to study ants.  The book is illustrated both black-and white photos and sets of color photographic plates.  There is an index, but surprisingly, there is no bibliography or recommendations for further reading; presumably, their main recommendation would be to consult their reference volume, The Ants.The first chapter in the book, The Dominance of Ants, stood out the most for me.  In this chapter, the authors note that ants are overwhelmingly the dominant species on earth.  By weight, the world ant population equals the world human population, and represents half or more of the world's insect biomass.  These ten thousand trillion creatures are spread throughout the world's habitats, from the Amazon to Finland, from deserts to rain forests.  With that in mind, the study of ants is clearly well-worth taking up.  Why are ants so populous and successful?  As the authors argue, one reason is their social nature.  They put the survival of the colony above their own individual survival.  Nevertheless, through quirks in their reproductive behavior, this cooperative behavior still maximizes the potential for their own genetic material to be passed on to future generations.  Just because they are social, however, doesn't mean that all is peaceful within the colony between individual ants, as Holldobler and Wilson point out.  These topics and many others are described in language that is very accessible to general readers.

48,Amazon,,"I was 13 years old when I read *Jubilee* for the first time.  I found it in the library and spent a rainy Saturday devouring the story.  After the last page was turned, I ran immediately to my grandmother (who was born in 1906, and therefore an expert in all things old) and asked her how any of this could possibly be true.  I knew about slavery from history books, but slave masters having children with slaves!  What followed was an eye-opening conversation about what our history REALLY was - and who the people of the south really were.  I never forgot the experience, and I never forgot the book.Now, I am 18 years older, and once again, on a rainy Saturday, I picked up a copy of *Jubillee* (this time from Square Books in Oxford) and read the whole book again.  The story was still as powerful, and I understood so much more than I could back then.  I understood the mastery of Walker's writing, the power of her story, and the incredible fairness and depth with which Walker crafted her novel.  So many voices of the South speak to us . . .The chief voice is of course Vyry's - it's her story.  She is the voice of forgiveness, compassion, fairness, and spirituality that reaches to so many.  She is also a voice that triumphs over the horrible suffering and injustice of the pre-Civil War South.  She endures Emancipation and Reconstruction - not quite the panacea of those history books that led me astray so young - and ultimately triumphs over hate in all its forms.  Her words concerning misunderstanding and reconciliation in the closing 4 chapters of the novel are some of the most powerful words in literature.  She is a heroine among heroines - a beautiful example of what it means for humanity to triumph over prejudice and adversity.  Alone, it would be a great tale, but the voices don't stop with Vyry alone . . .Each of the characters speaks for a class of those who grew up in the South:  the angry poor-whites (Grimes, the people who burn Vyry and Innis out of their home), the angry black men (Randall Ware, Jim to an extent), the privileged and cruel white upper class (Big Missy Salina), those among the white upper class who felt the injustice and yet were too cowardly to enact change (Marster Dutton and Miss Lillian), the freedom fighters that worked diligently to bring freedom (Brother Zeke), those who suffered before they saw the promised land (Mammy Sukey, Aunt Sally), and those who wanted to turn the labor that had been stolen for so long into proof of their worth (Innis Brown).  Not only are all these voices present, but they are treated with equal sympathy and truth.  Even the most evil of characters, like Grimes, is presented with compassion.  Even the most heroic of characters, like Randall Ware, is portrayed with human frailties in tact.  This is what makes *Jubilee* not just another slave novel, but a novel that really makes history alive.I am a descendant of the poor white class.  What *Jubilee* proved to me as a child was simple:  I shared more with people of color than I thought.  What it proves to me now is no less profound:  Our history and our heritage are bound together by threads that we may not understand, and yet they are undeniable.  Perhaps Vyry said it best:  we all need each other.

They always buy a package tour for umpteen thousands of dollars, stay at four-star hotels or on luxury cruise vessels, make no effort to read anything about the countries they're visiting because there's ""not enough time,"" and -- other than some nice photographic trophies and a few stories about the funny things their guide said -- don't know much more about their destinations after the trip than before.In his other books that I have read -- HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE and THE CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY -- Alain de Botton has succeeded to taking very complex material and distilling it down to a few home truths that are as enlightening as anything I have read on the subjects.You can imagine that I was eager to see what de Botton would do with travel, about which I know something because I love it above all other things in my life.

If so, man will be no happier under a palm tree in Bora Bora.There is one scene in the first chapter, ""On Anticipation,"" that summarizes it all for me. De Botton and his travelling companion get into a spat over who gets which portion of dessert. Despite the idyllic setting in Barbados, the day is spoiled for both of them:""There is a contrast between the vast projects we set in motion, the construction of hotels and the dredging of bays, and the basic psychological knots that undermine them, How quickly may the advantages of civilisation be wiped out by a tantrum. The intractibility of the mental knots points to the austere, wry wisdom of those ancient philosophers who walked away from prosperity and sophistication and argued, from within a barrel or a mud hut, that the key ingredients of happiness could not be material or aesthetic but most always be stubbornly psychological...""And there we get to the rub: This is a book about how travel can make you happy -- if you're ready for it",long,3054,533,neutral,neutral,good,"Before going on a vacation , I start a six-month reading program encompassing guidebooks , histories , biographies , and the literature of the country or countries I am visiting.When I visited Iceland in 2001 , for example , I read all the major medieval Icelandic sagas , anything I could find by Nobel Prize winner Halldor Laxness , histories , travel books by W.

It is interesting to read some of the early criticisms of the play and the essays really help you to think critically about the play and understand it better, as well as the historical background to it, and some of the early criticisms of it. Definitely recommended for serious scholarly study of the play.My main criticism of the play itself is Miller's EXTREMELY revisionist view of history. Miller seems to have done little if any historical research and has no understanding of the time period beyond what the average American has (or should have) and falls into the ""typical"" stereotypes regarding the Puritans. For example, he has a line to the effect that (and I am paraphrasing here) 'before Lucifer fell, even God thought him beautiful in heaven.' No Puritan would have said anything like this; this line and similar ones fly in the face of the doctrine of the omnipotence of God (i.e. the doctrine that God is all-knowing), which the Puritans STRONGLY affirmed. Miller presents the Puritans as a highly irrational, superstitious group, which couldn't be further from the truth. The Puritans placed a very high emphasis on logic and reason, and Isaac Watts (a Puritan) wrote one of THE standard textbooks on logic (which was used at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities for over 200 years and is still in print and available). The Puritan society had a much higher literacy rate than the U. S. does now. Perhaps I overemphasize this point; I realize that Puritan history is not the main point of the play, but his revisionist history sure does weaken his case and make it a frusterating read for anyone with more than a cursory undersanding of Puritan history. Much of this play is also higly speculative in history. Please, please, PLEASE do not read this play expecting ANYTHING historically accurate in the least about the Puritans! This play has done a tremendous amount of damage to understanding of the Puritans!Now that I have finished my diatribe, some of the critics have challenged Miller's analogy to McCarthyism, but there are some good essays on this in the book.

24,Amazon,,"Has it really been twenty years since John Piper first released Desiring God?  I had been thinking recently about abiding in Christ and the nature of desire, as well as the upcoming Together for the Gospel conference which Piper will speak at, so I thought it would be a good time to re-read this modern-day classic.For those who aren't familiar with it, twenty years ago a relatively little known young pastor from Minneapolis published a book that sent shock waves throughout the evangelical world and became the springboard for a ministry that now encompasses books, sunday school curricula, a radio show, and countless speaking appearances.  What was this radical message?  That God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him, that the chief purpose of man is to glorify God by enjoying Him forever. This proposition, that God actually created us and commands us to seek pleasure in Him, is what Piper deemed ""Christian hedonism.""  Although there are certainly seeds of this truth in the writings of Augustine, Edwards, Pascal, and Lewis (to name a few), Piper developed and brought it out full force onto the modern evangelical scene.  It brought him both acclaim and controversy, great joy and great conflict.It is impossible to condense a 350+ page intense theological tome down to a few paragraphs, and I will not even try.  The book begins with a chapter on how he developed his theology,and then outlines a theological basis for Christian hedonism. He next has chapters devoted to the transforming impact that desiring God has on worship, love, scripture, prayer, money, marriage, missions, and suffering. This is no touchy feely devotional book-it has 15 pages of chapter end notes annotating quotations from Baxter, Pascal, Henry, Packer, Edwards, Lewis, Bounds, Mueller, Barth, Murray, Polycarp, Augustine, and many more.  It references over 700 separate verses from the Bible.Every Christian needs to read this book and deeply think through its truths.

Read without fear!First, like other reviewers, I would strongly recommend that you buy vols 1 and 2 before reading this book.  This volume collects issues 13-18 of Astonishing X-men, but if you haven't read 1-12 most of what happens in these pages simply won't make sense.That said, I'm not going to cover the content of this book so much as Whedon's general approach to writing the X-Men.  Like many others, I enjoyed the Claremont works in the late 1970s but found that by the 1990s the X-Men story line was so convoluted it was difficult to really follow, especially as graduate school was taking more and more of my time. Whedon has limited the number of main characters in Astonishing X-Men to 6 and this allows him to focus on the unique personalities and interactions among the group.  As a result, the characters have more depth than ever before.  The issue in which the new team faces (individually) their worst fears (found in this volume) is a real triumph in comic writing.  Interestingly enough, this approach also removes Wolverine from center stage.  By far the two most interesting characters in Astonishing X-Men are Kitty Pryde and Emma Frost, each of whom acts as a perfect foil for the other throughout the series.  Indeed, the survival guilt of both Emma and Kitty feel in the wake of the mass destruction at Genosha frames this entire story arc.Cassady's artwork meshes perfectly with Whedon's writing.  Beast has a more cat-like appearance here than anywhere else and the transitions between his intellectual and feral self are simply stunning.  Even the supporting cast is drawn with sensitivity and truly come alive.  Agent Brand of SWORD, Blindfold, and even Lockheed all receive better portraits here than anywhere else.So why should you read this series, especially if you, like me, thought your comic reading days were past?  Simple.  Whedon and Cassady remain true to the characters we grew up loving, but this is clearly the adult version of X-Men.  The old X-Men were extraordinary, and very near unbeatable. They explored a variety of social issues, but always within the constraints of the ""comic book format.""  These new X-Men, despite, or perhaps even because of, their return to traditional comic costumes, are far more human in their hopes, fears, guilt, and love than many of their predecessors.  And they are far more interesting.

[Incidentally, the book's issues like this are debatably related to the topic of President Bush...]So much for the idea of a ""well-informed electorate!""Such voter intimidation is not just sad but almost laughable.First, does anyone want to admit depending on a voter base of individuals who fall for intimidation like this?  This was an insult to liberal causes!

Worse yet, Alterman and Green propose that a bad state of knowledge is further demonstrated by President Bush's tendency to ask ""stupid"" questions.  Perhaps all readers should reflect on whether it is better to have stupid questions asked than to have stupid results occur when nobody has the courage to ask stupid questions.

87,Amazon,,"	In Heresy, Magic, and Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe, Gary K. Waite attempts to tie together the various persecutions that took place in Early Modern Europe.  Whether persecution was aimed against Christian heretics, witches, or Jews, its purpose was always the same: reinforcing current orthodoxy against growing doubt.  Thus, Waite claims that the more pluralistic the society, the less fringe groups were persecuted.	This book is flawed.  Waite argues his thesis tendentiously, citing portions of scholarship on Early Modern Europe that support his claims and ignoring scholarship that would question them.  The book is a brief synthesis of other scholars' works, and Waite's contribution consists of mere assertions that lack supporting evidence.  Waite does not engage the sources of Early Modern Europe; instead he trusts others to do the work of research for him.  When he quotes a primary source, his citation is always from some secondary literature.  This form of ""researching"" may be fine for a survey of the historiography, but Waite is attempting to argue a thesis.	Not only is his methodology wanting, but also his thesis is much too simplistic.  Waite argues as societies become more pluralistic, persecution of the ""Other"" lessens.  He cites example after example of how the reigning orthodoxy persecuted the ""Other"" in order to strengthen its position in society.  Places like the Netherlands and Maria Theresa's Austria, however, did not persecute irrationally because of tolerance for a multiplicity of ideas.  This formulation is inadequate.  Waite fails to grapple with the religious situation in Spain in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.  Spain was the most ethnically and religiously diverse region in Europe, and its variegated population managed a high level of cooperation for centuries.  Instead of peaceful toleration, however, this region led to some of the most intense persecution of the ""Other.""	Waite's explanation of the Jewish situation in Early Modern Europe also has many problems.  He asserts, ""Jews ... were officially tolerated in the Christian west because they proved an extremely useful, if unwitting, ally in the campaign to expel religious doubt from the hearts of Christian believers"" (19).  As a causal claim, this statement is ludicrous.  Waite implies a conspiracy by the Church to use Jews to quench Christian doubt.  The evidence does not support this assertion.  (His reasons for the persecution of women during the witch-hunts similarly lack evidentiary substantiation.)	Not only are Waite's methods and assertions suspect, but he lacks a fundamental understanding of the subject that he is trying to address.  In the book's introduction, Waite writes, ""Religion is always nonrational, for its tenets cannot be proven by empirical testing"" (3).  This statement belies a misunderstanding of rationalism, religion, or both.  As a system of knowledge, rationalism is not dependent on evidence or empirical testing.  Rationalism relies on human reason.  Just as religion cannot be empirically tested, neither can mathematics.  Rationalism and empiricism are competing systems of knowledge.  Waite's conflation of the two demonstrates a positivist bent, and positivism is self-referentially absurd.  Thus, Waite founds his philosophical approach to this subject upon a defective meta-narrative, and readers should be skeptical of his claims",long,3399,510,neutral,neutral,neutral,"In Heresy , Magic , and Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe , Gary K.

Iyengar's book and see for yourself.Scott Shaw's book is an answer to any introductory pranayama and worths it's weight in gold.Following are two techniques:Alternate Nostril Breathing(Anulom Vilom Pranayama with no breath retention) This pranayama (control breathing) is done with alternate breathing from the left and right nostrils for cleansing of Nadis. (energy meridians). Seated in a convenient posture, start off with slow inhalation from the left nostril first by closing the right nostril with the middle of right hand thumb ,and after fully filling the lungs, (not the belly breathing) breathe out slowly from the right nostril by closing the left nostril with the two ( left hand middle and ring) fingers. Now breathe in from the right nostril by closing the left nostril in the above manner and exhale from the left nostril by closing the right nostril with the right thumb. It completes one cycle.  Do this for three minutes for two months then gradually increase to 5 minutes.		Do it two hour after eating  or drinking. (Do it on empty-stomach) Do not eat for 15 minute after you are done. Better to lie down for five minutes after you are done.  If you limit practice to maximum of five minutes, it will be the best.The very first sign you will experience is lightness in the body and clearer thinking.The practice of this breathing for a period of three to four months can open up thirty to forty percent of the heart arteries' blockages.

You can do this sitting, standing or walking anywhere anytime.2. Inhale slowly through both nostrils, keeping the throat slightly constricted so as to make a gentle sound that will help you to feel the breath in the throat. The sound will remind you of ocean waves washing up the beach. Concentrate on the feeling of the breath moving in and out through the throat.3. During inhalation do not allow abdomen to bulge out, let the chest expand.4. After completing inhalation slowly exhale. (Either by both nostrils or by left nostril) During exhalation chest should go inside and abdomen should remain steady.Remember :-1. While doing Ujjiayi air should touch the throat.2. Breath must be mentally locked in chest area. (Do not do belly breathing)3. After practicing it for few days, knowing your limitations, keep the ratio between inhalation and exhalation 1 : 2.4.

The ""facts"" presented are not facts at all, but typically one-line statements devoid of the context they were delivered in.  For example, he claims that Rick Warren is New Age because he attended a leadership conference at the Crystal Cathedral.  So I decided to check it out.  The next leadership conference was scheduled for January of 2005.  I registered and attended.  I attended every seminar and listened to every speaker I could.  Guess what?  Not a single scrap of new age teaching, not from Schuller nor any of the other speakers.  Smith also claims that the bookstore of the Crystal Cathedral sells new age and/or occultic literature.  But the truth is a simlple visit to their bookstore proved that to be false.  Perhaps Smith considers an art book by Sister Wendy, or the biography of baseball pitcher Jim Morris to be occultic?  Smith also fails to mention the fact that the Crystal Cathedral is a member of the Reformed Church in America, a mainline pretestant denomination whose lineage comes from John Calvin.  Perhaps Smith considers any nonevangelical church or denomination to be occultic or new age, I don't know.  Suffice it to say that his claims are either exaggerated or just plain false.Now, on to Rick Warren.  Smith attempts to paint Warren as a new ager via the aforementioned attendance at a Shuller-sponsored leadership conference,, but fails to establish the conference itself as teaching anything new age related.   Smith goes on to claim that Warren's phrases in the book, such as ""What is the driving force of your life?"" is new age in nature.  Yet, if one were to actually read PDL itself, it is clear that Warren is dirrecting the reader to God, and eventually to Christ himself.  This type of quoting without context is typical of what you read in Smih's book.  I'm sure Smith is aware that if he were to actually use the proper context, his claims would be revealed as false.  And, like above, Warren fails to mention that Rick Warren is a Southern Baptist minister.  Ministers of the Southern Baptist Convention aren't exactly known for ""new age"" views, but for instead being rather biblically fundamental, another point that Smith notably fails to mention.In the end, Smith's attempts to claim deception by making false claims and implications.  In some places, outright omissions to make his point.  By doing so, Smith not only paint a false picture or Schuller and Warren to attempt to make his point, but by doing so, he himself becomes what he accuses others of:  a deceiver.This book serves to do nothing but make money for the author by preying on the legitimate concerns of naive sheep by crying wolf",long,2831,480,neutral,neutral,good,"For example , he claims that Rick Warren is New Age because he attended a leadership conference at the Crystal Cathedral .<q>The `` facts '' presented are not facts at all , but typically one-line statements devoid of the context they were delivered in .<q>Smith goes on to claim that Warren 's phrases in the book , such as `` What is the driving force of your life ?

This book reads like the Christian version of &#34;Final Exit,&#34; reeking of the nihilistic determinism of death, though in the first half of the book, he blames everybody and everything for the &#34;theological shift,&#34; he claims, that has occurred.Countless times, (I gave up trying to count them all), he parlays that knowledge is by revelation ONLY, that reason is the cause for all of man's problems and difficulties; a conclusion which is patently false, because as the Bible states, sin is the cause of all of man's problems. He engages in a fallacial logical argument, where he negates at predicate twice to call it identity. For instance, instead of A is A as identity... He says that A is NOT Non-A. The statement A-&#62; ~(~A) is false when using quantitative reasoning, something to which Schaeffer objects. As a Christian, I was outright offended by the statement he makes, that unless you have the content of the meaning of the name of Christ that the people of the Reformation had, then Christ's name is meaningless, or so says Schaeffer.I also found that many questions I had while reading this were not answered, and some altogether avoided: If knowledge (wisdom, intelligence) is only gained by revelation, and only the select few are entitled to that revelation, should the rest of us remain ignorant? Schaeffer would say yes. If reason is so bad for man, why is anti-reason not the answer either? He goes through the line, Nature is bad, the principle of mechanics is bad, humanism is bad, freedom is bad, which would lead to the conclusion that intelligence is bad. He asks the question, &#34;How can unity exist when differences in thinking exist,&#34; to which I initially and facetiously replied &#34;Marriage.&#34;In his analysis of the Renaissance, he faults Thomas Aquinas for what he believes is the introduction of &#34;humanism&#34; into the doctrines of the church. Then he faults Leonardo da Vinci for Neo-platonist tendencies in Leo's works. &#34;Curse those inventions of Leo's mind,&#34; Schaeffer seems to say. The list could go on and on, but it occurs to me that the only theophilologer to which Schaeffer completely defends is Immanuel Kant, whose whole premise was that reason should be completely abandoned for man to survive, and then so what if he doesn't. So what Schaeffer really believes is that we should abdicate our minds, that things like this review have to be knowledge anomalies; that Christians are designed to be dumb and solfidious, (Justification by Faith Alone). Even when he clings to the existentialism of Karl Barth, Jean-Paul Sartre, (and Camus), he is forced to admit that his theory needs help from humanism, or else mankind has no redeeming value to himself or to God, (determinism, or in Christian circles, nihilistic pre-destination). It reminded me of the song, &#34;Gloom, Despair, and Agony on Me.&#34;Perhaps he should have read James 2:18, &#34;I have faith and you have works; show me your faith, and I will show you my faith by my works.&#34;  Unfortunately for Schaeffer, works would require that man know how to do things, a concept called intelligence and learning. This is ultimately a terrible book, offering no new thoughts or solutions, (how could he? the solutions have to be THOUGHT out.) to the continuing predicament in Christianity",long,3486,574,neutral,neutral,good,"For instance , instead of A is A as identity ...<q>Schaeffer 's work , Escape From Reason , leaves much to be desired in the way of 'penetrating ' thought .<q>He engages in a fallacial logical argument , where he negates at predicate twice to call it identity .","Schaeffer 's work , Escape From Reason , leaves much to be desired in the way of ` penetrating ' thought .

53,Amazon,,"I'll bet industry insiders really do love this book. It drastically overstates the number of manufactured homes being sold (as a percentage of all home sales), it drastically overstates their savings as opposed to site-built homes, brags about ""strict"" HUD requirements (which are anything but), etc. There is one factual error after another with nothing to back up the claims. Although Talylor stresses how much ""research"" went into this brief fluff piece, he doesn't site anyone or any study that I recall seeing. The worst part of the lies to me are his claims that ""the vast majority of home sales professionals are well-intentioned and eager to give you sincere advice and service . . . Some of the finest individuals I've known make their living in the manufactured housing business."" Well, that certainly conflicts with my experience when I went shopping at dozens of lots in two states, and it seems to be at odds with Consumer's Union finding that half of all consumer complaints involve fraud on the part of these ""fine"" individuals. I don't know where Mr. Taylor worked (he was an industry employee), but maybe it was on a different planet. The typical earthly dealership incarnation bears little resemblence to what Manufactured Homes: The Buyer's Guide describes. Specifically, Consumer's Union found several kinds of fraud prevalent (in the article ""In Over Our Heads"" / February 2002):* the dealership substituted a different home (another model, year, or size) for the one the customer thought they were buying* the dealership falsified information on the loan application (often lying about the down payment amount or accepting borrowed money as a down payment)* the dealership ended up charging more for the home than the price they originally quoted* the terms of the sale were changed on the customer midway through the deal (when momentum makes it hard to back out) and additional expenses were added like extra fees or higher interest rates* the dealership refused to give the customer copies of contracts they had to signWow, these guys do sound like the salt of the earth, don't they? In my on family's case, we were on multiple occasions asked to sign blank forms for our ""conveinence."" After the contract was official, and when we complained about things that weren't right, people from the dealership actually cussed us out!Another extremely important point is the home's set-up. Even the best manufactured home can be destroyed by a faulty set-up, and it won't be covered by warranty. I think Taylor devotes 1 or 2 inconsequential pages to this very important topic. Wes Johnson devotes 25 pages to the set-up in his book on manufactured homes (The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook), and 7 more just on the foundation itself. In fact, Johnson's book is the only one I've read that actually tells it like it is. If you're considering buying a manufactured home, or even if you've already bought one, you should buy The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook (ISBN 0-7864-2209-2). While Taylor, Burnside, and Grissim are sugar-coating the industry and basically getting their facts wrong over and over, Johnson's narrative rings true to experience.

68,Amazon,,"	What a ripoff! First of all, of the 25 magazine titles featured, only 8 could be called ""macabre pulps"" in the generally accepted meaning of the term. (And if you count cover images rather than titles, the macabre pulp representation is even smaller.) And at most only five more titles could be considered pulps at all, even if you stretch the term to include some quasi-pulp publications. As to the rest, though most are fantasy or occult related, very few are in the ""macabre"" category, and none of them are pulps by any stretch! These include: seven post-pulp era digests published as recently as 1973, including one that contains no fiction; a fanzine; three standard size (8 ½ by 11) non-macabre magazines published during the pulp era, including two that contain no fiction; and a standard sized post-pulp era non-fiction magazine. The book's text is extremely skimpy, for the most part merely recounting some publishing information gleaned from the indicia of the magazines. If the author is an expert on pulps, you'd never know it from this book. For each title there's a listing of all the articles and stories, by author, which is OK, although for the most part these writers are probably best forgotten. The biggest problem with the book is that the text is artificially bulked up, with the checklists in large type and spread out across the pages. There are only 104 cover reproductions in this 111 page book, but because text and checklists take up so much space, many of the covers are reproduced quite small. (I know--this is like the classic complaint about the restaurant that serves terrible food--and in such small portions!) If the contents checklists had been printed in small type two or three columns per page (preferably in the back of the book), the cover illustrations printed in a larger size, more pulp titles added to the book, and the book's title changed to ""Some Randomly Selected, Mostly Rare, Short-Run, Macabre, Occult and Fantasy Magazines Published Between 1919 and 1973,"" the book would still be a ripoff, but might barely be worth the Amazon discount price to the curious.

76,Amazon,,"&quot;Well-behaved women rarely make history,&quot; a quote by Laural Thatcher Ulrich, American Historian, are the first words of this book.  That may very well be, but I don't think we have to try so hard to show children just how shocking some of our famous women were!  Lives of Extraordinary Women is a compilation of twenty short biographies of important women in the world's history: such well-known names as Joan of Arc, Marie Antoinette, and Harriet Tubman, as well as lesser-known individuals such as Nzingha, Gertrude Bell, and Aung San Suu Kyi.  Although it looks like biographies, there is really little intellectual value to the book.  It is merely a hodgepodge of trivia and unrelated gossip.    The first chapter is called &quot;Cleopatra: Life at the Library.&quot;  Now, you would think that this would explore her love of reading and dertmination to build a world-famous library in Alexandria.  Instead, it is all about her numerous love-affairs, particularly the one with herself, experimenting with hairstyles, make-up, and perfume.  The author tells us, &quot;...she coped with the required marriage to her ten year-old brother.  He turned up drowned, and another one was poisoned.&quot;    There is a chapter on Nzingha - a West African queen.  Some important aspects of her life we just must know are: &quot;Rumor had her also murdering her nephew - and eating his heart,&quot; and &quot;...she kept fifty young men as bodyguards...she made her favorites wear women's clothes.&quot;    It gets even better!  We simply can't live without knowing that Catherine the Great's husband, Peter, &quot;heaped abuse on her, tortured their dogs...and brought his toy soldiers to bed, forcing her to participate in mock military maneuvers.&quot;    If the purpose of this book is to sensationalize the names of women in history, then it has met it's mark.  I'm not against books that attempt to amuse kids with humorous or unbelievable-but-true anecdotes.  I think the problem with this, however, is that today's educators are grabbing quickly for resources about women.  After ceturies of learning about history through the eyes of men, society is realizing that a big piece has been missing.  As educators, we are making a conscious effort to locate and use resources about women in history.  Because of this book's striking cover, catchy title, boldly illustrated caricatures, and interesting table of contents, we might be fooled into thinking this is a good book for our classrooms.  A careful reading of the pages will tell you a different story.    In the introduction, the author says, &quot;Here are twenty women who wielded significant political power.  Each of these extraordinary women triumphed over attitudes and conditions that couldn't have been more adverse.&quot;  These statements make us think that they are women to look up to.  And, although she also says, &quot;Not all of these women are role models,&quot; in the next sentence she says, &quot;Their stories are offered here to inspire awe at the power of women throughout history - and ever after.&quot;  If these behaviors are the best we have to inspire awe at the power of women, our role in history is doomed for another twenty centuries!

Basically, if you don't live as a cher-worshipping rainbow flag waving poster child of gaydom, the book paints you as a maladjusted closet case who should be avoided at all costs.  I agree with the review that said this is a good guide to turning into a ""flaky queen"".  Also, I cannot even count the number of times alcohol is referred to in this book (and I rarely drink) but any drug use is met with a ""kick him to the curb, girlfriend"" attitude (I don't do drugs either, but I'm just pointing it out).  The book does not answer any central questions about what men want.  There is research out there about how important a good body *really* is and how important masculine traits really are for a relationship vs. hookup.  This author did not pull any of that in.  However, there is an underlying assumption that ALL gay men go to the gym, and usually that is an all-gay gym (so I guess a good body is really important to him...).  As far as the authors take on the value that gay men place on education or personal growth - oh wait - neither topic is ever mentioned.  The whole book can be summed up with the fact that the author actually gives advice on ""what to say if he catches you looking at his Streisand CDs when he comes out of the bathroom"".  So, essentially, the book is a disappointing series of common-sense superficial tips that anyone who went to high school already knows:  ""don't seem needy or desperate, be confident, don't go into your whole life story on the first date.""

Um, by the time a guy is in my bathroom, he is probably on his way to having sex with me so I think it'll just have to be ok if he sees moisturizer with retinol.  If he wants to end the relationship over my brand of shaving cream (yes, that is mentioned as well) then I'm done too.

59,Amazon,,"There are SOOOO many GREAT books about wicca out there I certainly wouldn't waste my money again on this book, and I suggest others don't either. It is a lot of pop propaganda made to make wicca and witchcraft look like something out of the movies. It is full of false information made just to look cute so it will sell, sell, sell. This book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning Wicca or witchcraft in general.This supposedly ""advanced"" book doesnt go into details on how to make your spells better, how to connect with nature, how to beome stornger. It doesnt encourage deep thinking and lots of factual information. It DOES however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell out loud from the book and it will all work in a puff of blue smoke.This book is not about a different of opinions or different practices, it is about portraying a real, serious, religion as a fun and games, do whatever you want choice as she mixes in things in tradtional witchcraft that has been shown to have the oppsite and/or nagative effects, as well as doing spells which do not follow the Wiccan rede. Even though I am not in a coven I understand wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed. It is not 'do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan'. Yes some things in religion are personal choices but the building blocks of the religion are totally lost on her. Freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right but if your choice is to make up your own religion you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways, Unfortunatly that is EXACTLY what ravenwolf does. She doesn't differentiate between the Wiccan and Paganism, in fact she barely cover the topics at all giving vague rehashed information from her other books.

My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc. I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment.

End""Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say ""Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer"". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say.

95,Amazon,,"As neither a conservative or liberal I was interested in what the book would say and how it would document and factually support its arguments.  As an ex-college debater I think I can say with some authority that this book does not do what it claims to do.  If you were to rely on this book in a formal debate you would lose.  Let me give you 5 examples of why I come to this conclusion.1)	Documentation is thinner than appears.  Chapter 8 on healthcare has 20 endnotes.  But 12 of those footnotes are duplicates often citing the same single page in its source.  So the book presents 8 total sources on the topic.  But of the 8 remaining sources 4 of them are editorial/opinion pieces on the topic.  So, at best, the chapter offers 4 fact sources for a discussion of national health care.2)	Undocumented quotes and poor quoting practice.  A large number of statements attributed to people and research institutions without attribution.  Page 354 "". . . illegal aliens used 10 billion more in government services than they paid in taxes in 2002 according to a 2004 Center for Immigration Studies . . . ""  No endnote.

Although this statement is something of a sidebar in a discussion of education, such a sweeping and factually incorrect statement without even a footnote is just amazing.  This is not atypical.4)	Confusing fact with opinion.  As I mentioned in 2 a large number of Mr Jackson's book are opinion pieces.  Although the books he sources may all be fact filled, looking at the publisher list (Crossways Books, Andrews & McMeel, WallBuilder Press, Kregel Publications, Prima Publishing) indicates vanity press and self published sources.  5)	Failure to update.

55,Amazon,,"I really disliked this book for several reasons. Lasch isn't a clear writer; he rarely makes his own opinions or arguments apparent. Despite the book's polemical title, it mostly recounts intellectual history, namely the evolution of the concept ""family"" in the social sciences from the late 19th century. Lasch's style shifts abruptly from dryly summarizing and analyzing the positions of those he likes (Waller, Parsons to a degree, anyone remotely Freudian) to offhandedly dismissing those he doesn't (most radicals and feminists). He wastes a lot of space on marginal figures and keeps the really important ones (Marx, Freud) in the background as a sort of assumed ground for his analysis. This might be the most irritating aspect of the book: he's heavily invested in Freudian psychology and treats it as gospel, at times making grossly unfounded claims based upon Freud's speculations. The book is uneven too: these Freudian ideas appear mostly in the final chapters, while the book begins in a very Marxist frame of reference. Oddly, Lasch seems to use all these theories for rather conservative ends. And Lasch's own smarmy preface shows that other readers have had the same reactions that I do. The main point of the book seems to be that the modern ""haven"" form of the family needs to be preserved against the ""progressive"" forces of modern society, especially the medical and psychiatric and other professions (i.e., Jacques Donzelot's ""the social"") that seek to replace it. Lasch seems to think that the haven family-by combining love with authoritarian discipline-is perhaps the only thing that can create strong, integrated, individual personalities. The permissive, friendly family and the intervention of ""the social"" professions only creates weaklings, nihilists, and totalitarian personalities. Lasch's support for this conclusion is unconvincing: he basically says that without the combination of love and discipline in the same unit (a mother and a father), the child will eventually come to see authorities as simultaneously personable and distantly oppressive. The result is the antisocial or ""narcissistic"" personality, premised on the avoidance of conflict and ""liberation"" from emotional entanglements. This personality also demonstrates a reliance on institutional forms of authority (e.g., mass media) combined with a conspiratorial suspicion of authority (due to lack of any real disciplinary figure-a strong father in other words). This seems like a conservative twist on Susman's character/personality distinction, Riesman's self/other-directed personalities, and the Frankfurt School's analyses of totalitarianism.If the ""haven"" form of the family arose-ironically, as Lasch notes-out of modern society and capitalist culture, as a counterbalance to competition and so on, then how can it ever hope to be anything but a palliative measure? If work was ever to be ""reorganized"" along more humane lines (xvii), as he calls for in crypto-Marxist fashion, then why would the family even be necessary? Assuming that the intervention of the social actually is undermining privacy, why is privacy a good thing? Why try to prop up the haven rather than make the world less heartless? I think Lasch is a neo-liberal; he assumes that experts can't be controlled by society, he expects that any collective will be totalitarian and oppressive, and he defends privacy (the essence of private property) without question. He's also quite sexist, presupposing that only a father's authority can create a well-adjusted child. If you're interested in family studies, I'd recommend the following books instead: - Barrett & McIntosh. The Anti-Social Family.- Coontz. The Way We Never Were.- Foucault. History of Sexuality, Vol 1.- Coontz. Social Origins of Private Life.- Zaretsky.

57,Amazon,,"I have two good points on these books: One, they're a quick read, and two, a friend lent me a couple, so I didn't waste any money.The first and second ones were kind of fun reads, but I would have enjoyed these more when I was 15, when I didn't have any mileage on me. As for the mysteries,  the killers weren't totally obvious, but I can't say I'd give credit to Harris' ability to craft a mystery. For me, I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters; I just found them sort of disposable.The lead character, Sookie Stackhouse (yeah, she's got a big rack and vampires and other supernatural beasties, just like most mortal men, can't resist a good pair of melons), has a ""disability,"" which is basically the ability to read minds -- not always a good thing, if you've got all that static to tune out and haven't developed a filter. Sookie isn't that well educated, as in going to college, because she was only good at homework, so she works as a bar maid and prides herself on being book learned and loves to use words from her word-a-day calendar. To her great relief she meets a vampire, Bill, whose mind she can't read, and they begin to date. In her world, vampires are now legal, with clubs and ""fang-bangers"" who sleep with vampires, and the Japanese have developed a synthetic blood, making it unneccessary for vamps to feed on humans (not that it's totally stopped them). But Sookie starts to date Bill, loses her virginity to him (setting up for sex scenes, a big part of the series, which probably are exciting for a virgin to read -- there's no titilation or intriguing detail or seduction here). In the meantime, Sookie meets more vampires and other supernatural creatures, and ends up using her power to try and solve assorted murders and missing-beings cases. She also gets recruited by vampire Eric (someone who has more power than Bill, and who wants Sookie for more than her telepathy) to help solve various mysteries, and Sookie gets into scrapes along the way. This description, by the way is not plot specific to Book 2, or even Book 1, but that's kind of the pattern that's emerging in the series.  It's basically the misadventures of a busty telepath among the supernatural world.These books are the literary equivalent of potato chips: A couple taste good, but the whole bag isn't going to do much for you except give you fat and empty calories and a stomach ache.

86,Amazon,,"""Fidel: Hollywood's Favorite Tyrant"" is the kind of radical right-wing piece of hate speech so commonly published and rarely ever read or taken seriously except by radical right-wingers who've already made their mind up about the subject. Do the research and you will see that most of Humberto Fontova's facts are completely off. Che Guevara for example was not a Stalinist, he was a Marxist, true, but he even cautioned against implementing EVERY Marxist idea to a society (this is outlined in ""The Che Guevara Reader""). Fontova's claims of the Cuban system are also off, Cuba has the highest life expectancy rate in Latin America and even the purest water sources for the population. Fontova obviously belongs to the hateful Miami Cuban Mafia that would be happy to see Cuba return to it's previous status of a virtual U.S. colony and racist state. Fontova rarely ever touches upon the fact that the United States waged an illegal terrorist campaign on Cuba that has killed hundreds (unlike the false ""genocide"" numbers Fontova provides here which are ludicrous), in fact, one of the key terrorist, Luis Posada Carrilles, is in U.S. custody and has admitted to blowing up a Cuban airliner with 75 civilians onboard, the Bush White House refuses to extradite him. Fontova calls popular figures such as Oliver Stone ""idiots,"" eventhough he probably couldn't hold his own on a debate with Stone and goes on to lash at other cultural figures (I suppose Fontova also considers Nobel-Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Marquez to be a half-wit for his friendship with Castro). To make matters worse, Fontova has a dead writing style that borders on the monotone. The use of language is bare and simplistic, throwing accusations without facts, attacking others without valid reason and supporting terrorist actions against a sovereign nation. For the real facts on Cuba I would recommend the titles published by Ocean including ""Fidel: My Early Years,"" ""Che Guevara Reader,"" ""Latin America: A Continent Awakens"" and many others.

70,Amazon,,"If you are looking for a serious discussion of 1,000 classic films, perhaps as a starting point for your own voyage of discovery, this book is a total waste of money. Spend your money on ""1001 Films You Must See Before You Die"" and Roger Ebert's Great Movies series instead.Here are some of the reasons why I do not like this book:1--The reviews begin in 1931, which means that the book completely ignores the silent era. No book pretending to discuss the 1,000 greatest movies ever made can ignore that era. How can you ignore the best work of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd? How can you ignore the work of David Wark Griffith, such as ""Birth of a Nation"" and ""Intolerance""? How can you ignore Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potemkin"" or Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan Of Arc,"" which many would rank among the 10 greatest films of all time?2--The book covers only films that were reviewed in the New York Times. Thus it is limited in its scope. It ignores a large body of great films that were not reviewed in the Times for whatever reason.3--The reviews were all written under deadline pressure, with little time for reflection and perspective. In the days before television, when the newspaper business was very competitive, many large papers published multiple editions each day, and deadline pressure was very tight. I was a newspaper reporter in my early days, and I know what it was like.In addition, these reviews were written on typewriters, not computers. There was little opportunity for revision. The way that the page came out of your typewriter the first time around was the way that the review appeared in print.It's only fair to point out that many of today's newspaper-based film critics, such as Roger Ebert, are able to write thoughtful reviews under deadline pressure. However, I suspect that they have more resources available to them, and more options as well, than the critics who wrote most of the reviews in this book.The bottom line is that in most cases, the thoughtfulness and reflection are not there. Most of the reviews seem to be geared toward answering the reader's simple question, ""Is the movie any good?"" The reviews are more akin to Ebert and Roeper's ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" television reviews than to the far more thoughtful ones that Ebert writes for his newspaper.

77,Amazon,,"I found ""The Forever War"" a forever let-down. Considering all the hype and the Hugo and Nebula awards, I would have expected much better.The main complaint is the irrelevant ending.  We get to know and care about characters, and follow their thorny path along the plot, wonder where they go, and who they will become at the end of the story, and then !BLAM-O!  We get an ending--a sappy, car crash, too pat ending--that had nothing to do with the previous 34 chapters. In business, we would call this fraud; in law, breach of contract.This slipshod ending is either do to Haldeman's artistic ability, or it is a reflection of his worldview.  It cannot be the first--Haldeman has that rare flair to mix science with narrative, which makes for top notch sci-fi.  (His use of time dilation is a masterstroke) Therefore I think it comes from his worldview, which, like most people of his generation, was hastily generalized by the events of the late 1960's and early 1970's.   To paraphrase Jack London, I got the feeling that his generalizations (like many of his generation) were made between the Summer of Love and the Fall of Saigon, and he had failed to revise them since then.So is this a critique of Heinlein's book ""Starship Troopers"" or a critique of Nam?  I go back and forth with this novel.  It does serve to temper Heinlein's idealism--the ""if men were angels"" problem--but it also serves to normalize (or at least desensitize) madcap behavior.  In this way, the book is a less funny ""Catch-22"" or a cosmic ""Caine Mutiny.""Of course Heinlein, as a non-combat servicemen, knew how sailors talked and drank and did AHEM, but his book is clearly didactic, while Haldeman's is merely descriptive.  Even so, I felt manipulated.  All the career servicemen were jingoistic warmongers; all the conscripted NCOs were morally pure victims.  And calling some of the aliens ""teddy bears"" was cheap saccharine.  Additionally, there is the prepubescent glee in transforming Heinlein's juvie into an adult novel--complete with adult situations, adult language, and rampant adultery.The chapters (especially the earlier ones) were formulaic:1.	They are given new orders that do not make any sense.2.	Something goes wrong with the irrational orders.3.	S.N.A.F.U.4.	Mandella and a female NCO have AHEM.The characters had no motivation, just passive shoulder shrugging. In this sense they are not protagonists, just placeholders who use sex as escape.  In turn, the genetically altered post-humans become homosexual, so even that one release is removed.  Unlike Augustine, Thomas Aquinas or Galahad, once Mandella becomes chaste, he never became interesting.  ""My strength is as the strength of ten/Because my heart is pure.""Even so, Haldeman doe illustrate some important flaws with conscription, casual drug use, casual sex, government solipotence, government deception.  (Keeping in mind that all of these go hand-in-hand). Furthermore, the book may have been helpful in the post-Vietnam era, as a release and a reaffirmation of what just happened.

96,Amazon,,"General Smedley Butler wrote a book called ""War is a Racket.""  He saw first hand how keeping people at each other's throats was good for some businesses and kept the elites in power.  The war on immigrants is also a racket.  Billions of our tax dollars will be spent for a high-tech wall, aerial drones, night goggles, detention centers, motion detectors and all manner of police state accoutrements.  There's a rumor going around that corporate interests are spending a bunch of money to corrupt our politicians and to get policies passed that will enrich them.  I imagine if we could surveil the activities of J. D. Hayworth and Tom Tancredo, we'd see them receiving large amounts of cash and other favors from the companies that will be profiting from the hysteria over immigration.There are plenty of alternatives to ""getting tough"" on immigrants, like fair trade, reforming NAFTA and the WTO, ending US support for the suppression of labor here and abroad, and compensatory funding for poorer nations; but none of those approaches will bring revenues to the industries our politicians are owned by.  On top of that, some US citizens just seem to get bored if they aren't filled with fear and resentment of poor, brown people.Notice how much attention the Minute Men get, while there are all sorts of unarmed civic groups working on the issues of immigration, like Border Links, which addresses issues of global trade and neoliberal economics, and also understands the history of the border.  In fact, whatever Latin Americans are getting from travelling to the US should be viewed as reparations for the US stealing half of Mexico in 1846.  Ulysses Grant called the US invasion of Mexico ""the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.""  Not surprisingly, Hayworth's book doesn't spend anytime on this history.It's amazing how much resentment some US citizens have for people who pick their food, take care of their children, take care of their lawns and do other work while we experience a shrinking domestic labor supply with the retirement of baby-boomers.  Immigrants also enrich our country's culture in so many ways, by practicing the faith and family values our corrupt politicians like to preach about.  Additionally, we have some immigrants taking the risks to provide marijuana to a pot-hungry nation.  Intensifying the war on pot is another aspect of this war on immigrants.  Big Pharma doesn't like any competition for the drugs they sell like zoloft and prozac, so putting immigrants in cages for years on end for smuggling pot will increase their business, and provide more money for our growing prison industry.  In fact, Lehman Brothers and other investment firms have invested a lot in our prison system, and they're going to need bodies in those cages to get a return on their investment; hence, the immigrant scare.  Maybe we should tear down the Statue of Liberty since she advocates all that stuff about ""bring me your tired, your poor"" and so forth.  This new generation of US natives if very frightened, and wants a big government fortress to protect them, and maybe give them a well-paying job as an ICE agent or detention center guard.

90,Amazon,,"This book represents everything that is wrong in music theory education.  This book approaches music as an abstract entity even though it provides many examples and exercises.  It tries to compartmentalize different aspects of music, like harmony, melody, rhythm and form.  I don't think it's the authors' fault entirely.This is a book on tonal harmony.  It has become the standard textbook for music theory in the United States.  This is extremely misguided since it will give the student an extremely incomplete understanding of how music works.  For example, counterpoint is not taught in this book.  Counterpoint has been considered essential for the serious musician for the past 500 years.  All the different aspects of music mentioned above are wholly intertwined.  Any approach that seperates them misses the point.  This book also puts too much emphasis on harmony as a vertical phenomenon.  Most people experience music as a horizontal phenonmenon and I haave found that approaches to music theory that treats music as such has had much more success.  This goes back to why counterpoint is so essential in music theory.  Learning harmony through an approach that pays attention to how melody, rhythm, and counterpoint affect harmony is the most honest and least troublesome way of learning how music works.This may explain why many have had trouble with this book(I had for 5 years).  You'll know how to name things such as chords and form after completing this book, but it won't help you understand how a piece works.  It focuses more on nomenclature than on syntax and function.There are a slew of books that will give the music student a more complete picture of theory.  Most importantly, these more integrated methods will give better tools to understand the music they may be performing and/or studying.  These books include Leo Kraft's Gradus, Aldwell and Schachter's Harmony and Voice Leading, Horton and Ritchey's Harmony Through Melody, Siegmeiter's Harmony and Melody, and to a lesser extent Forte's Tonal Harmony in Concept and Practice.  I am an active conductor and I feel I have a much stronger grasp of music after having been taught a more honest and comprehensive way of studying music and this was only after years of deprogramming what I had learned through the Kostka and Payne.

58,Amazon,,"From reading all the previous praise of this book one would get the impression that Aimee Bender is on par with Mother Goose. This praise is gratuitous at best. In every story, Bender consistantly breaks the number one rule of good fiction, the ""show, don't tell rule"". Here are some excerpts from GIRL IN A FLAMMABLE SKIRT as examples. In fact, I'm going to open the book at random to find examples: (1) from ""Legacy"": ""On the set of her fifth movie, the starlet was sitting at her makeup table feeling inestimably sad. I have beauty and fame and riches and boyfriends she thought, and yet I am so unhappy."" (2) from ""The Ring"": [a girl is saying ""yes"" to a marraige proposal from a cohort, while they're robbing a house] ""And right there in the stranger's kitchen I said yes to that robber and both of our eyes filled with tears at the rightness of it all. Shutting the front door quietly behind us, we walked hand in hand to the car; when he said we were far enough away, I let out a shout of joy."" And these are just two random examples! There are many more.Bender's prose is so sparse that emotion fails to exist in her stories. Instead, Bender needs to rely on telling the reader what emotions are happening instead of showing them. Unlike Hemingway, Bender's sparse prose doesn't work. There are not enough words to hold up the feelings Bender is trying to get through.The symbolism Bender uses in many of her stories is interesting, but without craft, the symbolism becomes nothing more than a gimmick. Yes, it's interesting to think of the symbolism and what it all means, but if there is no emotion conveyed through the writing then who cares? The characters are two-dimensional, the plots are weak, and if the stories themselves are held together by only symbolism, then what's the point?People have praised these stories for their fairy-tale quality and their fantastic imagery. I think the only fantastic thing that has happened here is that Aimee Bender has become so popular.

111,Amazon,,"I bought this set originally as individual CD's but thankfully was able to trade them in once I found out it had been boxed and got it with the Atlantic 8 CD box. They complement each other quite well with very minimal repition between the two sets. Originally this Stax/Volt set was released as a LP Sized box set with an appropriately sized booklet, so my review is based on that format. This set contains all of the Stax/Volt single ""A"" sides and key ""B"" sides to boot between the years 1959 and 1968 when Stax/Volt & Atlantic parted ways. The book is extremely informative, with great colour photos of original labels and the artists in question. I'm assuming it has maintained the same level of thoroughness in it's smaller format judging by the photo above. Like the Atlantic box this is an essential collection that serious music collectors should have and an incredible education on the roots of black soul music. Being Australian I hadn't heard 95% of this or the Atlantic stuff before with the odd Otis Redding, Booket T. & The MG's & Sam And Dave tracks reaching the airwaves or record shelves here. It's only with adult hindsight that I was able to delve backwards to investigate further.. I was in ""Time Warp"" mode back in the late 80's/Early 90's thanks to a similarly named Record store here in Sydney. This set is lovingly compiled and most of the tracks reveal a gritiness missing from today's so-called version of R & B (don't start me on that!) There isn't a lot I can add that my fellow reviewers haven't already stated. From one stand point this music is probably very personal to those who grew up listening to it (like the Beatles for me). But I love soul music too and to hear the grooves put out by that Stax/Volt house band puts so many others to shame for sheer quality and toughness. There are probably those who don't understand the difference between Motown & Stax/Volt/Atlantic. From an Aussie view, it's like comparing the Beatles & the Stones.. The Beatles would be Motown (slick & professional, great sounding records but tough when need be - they were fans of and influenced partly by that label) while the Stones would Stax/Volt/Atlantic (not as slick in appearance, rough on the edges but bluesy & gritty - most of their influences came from the deep south & Chicago blues). I hope that make sense. I've wanted to get the other 2 Stax sets for a while and maybe down the track I will..it's on my 5 year wishlist plan!

106,Amazon,,"Advise and Consent (Otto Preminger, 1962)During my college days, I had a friend who would go on for long periods about how great a film Advise and Consent is. At the time, young, impetuous, and somewhat skeptical of her taste in film (I mean, Broadcast News was her favorite movie of all time), my stock response was ""it's a movie about a Senate hearing, and it's got Betty White. How good can it really be?""Well, it's fifteen years and change later, and I have now seen Advise and Consent, and I have my answer: a movie about a Senate hearing can be as good as Advise and Consent, and I can't imagine one being any better than this.Robert A. Leffingwell (Henry Fonda) is the President (Dark Waters' Franchot Tone)'s nominee for Secretary of State. He is violently opposed by Seab Cooley (Charles Laughton in his final film role), the senior senator from South Carolina, who implies Leffingwell's a communist. Cooley produces a witness who will testify to this, one Herbert Gelman (Burgess Meredith). Leffingwell destroys Gelman on cross-examination, but later confides to the president that Leffingwell and Gelman were, in fact, both members of the same communist cell in Chicago. And that's only the tip of the iceberg.One of the reasons, I think, why this movie is so fantastic is in the number of ways it could have gone so very, very wrong. This is melodrama at its lowest, Peyton Place combined with Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and yet it never feels like melodrama. It's always controlled, even in those scenes where the script is enticing characters to overact with every syllable. A number of casting decisions were questionable, though in hindsight they seem adventurous (Betty White as a senator?), but all of them turned out just fine. The movie runs over two hours at one of those times in history when shorter films were more popular. It's in black and white. To put it bluntly, it's a throwback to a pre-Peyton Place era, the same way Psycho was two years previous. And, just like Psycho, it's a gamble that paid off handsomely; Advise and Consent has garnered a deserved reputation over the years as the finest political thriller of its time, if not the finest ever made. **** ",long,2195,380,neutral,suboptimal,good,"It 's in black and white .<q>To put it bluntly , it 's a throwback to a pre-Peyton Place era , the same way Psycho was two years previous .<q>He is violently opposed by Seab Cooley ( Charles Laughton in his final film role ) , the senior senator from South Carolina , who implies Leffingwell 's a communist .","He is violently opposed by Seab Cooley -LRB- Charles Laughton in his final film role -RRB- , the senior senator from South Carolina , who implies Leffingwell 's a communist .

No. Is it the most entertaining comedy ever made?No. Is it an influential and innovative comedy that is entertaining and deserves to be #1. Yes. I didn't expect this film to be funny at all (despite the fact that Jack Lemmon was in it), but I was really surprised. There are genuinely funny moments in this film, even though I've seen several films before this one with virtually the same plot. Tony Curtis (who I'd only seen previously in The Boston Strangler) and Jack Lemmon play two musicians Joe and Jerry. Joe is a saxophone player, Jerry plays bass...After the two witness a mob shooting, they dress in drag and join an all female band heading to Florida. Joe becomes Josephine, Jerry becomes Daphne. Which are the names that you will pretty much get to know these characters as for the rest of the film. Anyway, aboard the train Joe and Jerry simultaneously fall in love with the band's sensuous singer Sugar (Marilyn Monroe, who I'd never seen on film before and I suddenly find myself transfixed on her). Sugar is definitely hot, she's very sexual without being overly sexual. She teeters on the brink of teasing almost. Once they arrive in Florida, Joe disguises himself as a millionaire (while still under the guise of Josephine) and begins to woo Sugar;While a real millionaire named Osgood (Joe E. Brown, who steals almost every scene he is in) falls for Jerry. Does this film have homosexual overtones that probably weren't meant to be that way in the 50's? Yes.Monroe doesn't have the strongest singing voice (something her character admits early on), but in this film...The way she plays the character works on such a wonderful level, that you don't really care. When Jerry and Joe begin to fall in love with her, I could see and feel what they were falling for. I heard a quote by Tony Curtis that went like this ""Kissing Marilyn was like kissing Hitler."" This next quote is from Roger Ebert ""While watching the film I couldn't help but think, Hitler must have been a great kisser."" I concur. For a film that is #1 on this list, the film has a lot of screw-ups. Not flaws, the film is great...But screw-ups. First off, Tony Curtis's Josephine voice is actually dubbed by another actor. The dubbing is flawless, although the voice sounded curiously like Divine, the female impersonator who will forever be remembered for a dog walking scene in Pink Flamingos. Also, Monroe had problems remembering her lines and one scene you can tell she's reading from cue cards off a blackboard (the scene where she talks over the phone with Joe). The movie is entertaining, funny, and has some wonderful performances. The final line of the film, spoken by Osgood when Jerry reveals he's a man is one of my favorite lines in film history. This may not be the best comedy ever made, but I do think that any comedy fan should see this film. It's wonderful.GRADE: A-",long,3201,571,suboptimal,good,good,Tony Curtis ( who I 'd only seen previously in The Boston Strangler ) and Jack Lemmon play two musicians Joe and Jerry .<q>Is this the funniest film ever made ?<q>Some Like it Hot is # 1 on The American Film Institute 's Top 100 Comedies .,"Some Like it Hot is # 1 on The American Film Institute 's Top 100 Comedies .

112,Amazon,,"Chevelle's first album might come as a shock to those initiated with the more recent albums (""Wonder What's Next"" and ""This Type Of Thinking (Could Do Us In"")), mainly because it sounds like a totally different band! Not that their new style is a bad thing, I love Chevelle, and the new sound is working for them just as well, but ""Point #1,"" their debut, is just phenomenal. An undiscovered gem. I've had this CD since it's release in 1999, so listening to it provides a lot of nostalgia for me, and it holds a special place in my heart. This album is full of passion, intensity and pure emotion. Pete Loeffler, guitarist and vocalist, shines through with thoughtful, often cryptic and poetic lyrics, while his voice often echoes that of Maynard James Keenan, but with it's own distinct sound. His brothers, Joe and Sam, back him up on bass and drums (respectively) and the dynamic between the three is unbelieveable. Despite the fact that they reportedly fight a lot, whenever they get together, the combination is explosive and shows in the music. The album begins with the appropriately titled ""Open,"" a two minute instrumental that primes you up for the album, and showcases some solid musicianship. The song bleeds into the next, the now classic ""Point #1,"" which is my personal favorite Chevelle song of all time (anyone remember that creepy video they did for it?), and shows off what Chevelle are all about. The album continues along at a fast pace, slowing down briefly for the emotionally draining and beautiful ""Dos,"" but the pace is picked up by more uptempo tracks like ""Sma"" and ""Mia."" A lot of people tote Chevelle as Tool sound-alikes, but I only hear it in Pete's voice. Musically, I always though of them as being more in common with Helmet, as displayed on songs like ""Skeptic"" and ""Long."" ""Prove To You"" is one of the defining moments of the album, and is pretty much the only song that sounds at all like what they do today. The album as a whole is just beautiful. I'm sure many new people are discovering this album, due to their success, and realizing what Chevelle is all about.

110,Amazon,,"When I adopted a cat a couple of weeks ago, two of my good friends highly recommended Fresh Step Premium Clay Cat Litter. Here's why--This Fresh Step Premium Clay Cat Litter is excellent for your favorite kitty's litter box. The company states that it is very good at absorbing odors--and, by golly, it's TRUE! The odors are minimal at the very most and it is quite comfortable even for my rather sensitive cat. Moreover, I really like how the litter has the capacity to absorb and prevent odor causing bacteria in the litter before my cat even uses his litter box. That's a plus for any cat lover!If you have more than one cat the manufacturer does recommend, not surprisingly, that you use more cat litter in the box. Otherwise, if you have just one cat, two or three inches worth of this cat litter spread about evenly throughout the empty litter box will do fine. You should change the entire litter box once a week on average. (I change mine about twice a week just for my cat's comfort.)It's also a good idea to scoop out any ""kitty remains"" every other day or so. Be very certain NOT to flush any ""kitty presents"" down the toilet as the manufacturer warns against this. I suppose it could clog toilet pipes. Moreover, as you may suspect, any ""kitty leftovers"" could have some nasty germs that we don't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean the box or even after you just remove any ""kitty presents"" with a scooper.The fact that this is clay litter helps because you can use a very inexpensive litter scooper to remove any ""kitty presents,"" thus reducing the number the times you need to change the entire kitty litter box. Nevertheless, I recommend changing the entire litter box at least once a week. Place the contents of the used litter box into a trash bag and discard as you would any other garbage.In short, this is a great cat litter product at a great price. The contents of the bag last a long time, especially if, like me, you have only one cat. The manufacturer also offers customers (us, not the cats) an ""awards"" program with points that you can accumulate in your ""account"" with the company on the company Internet website. A nice plus!

113,Amazon,,"Everything you've heard about Jandek is true. And everything you've hear about Jandek is wrong. Alot of people who are interested in indie rock or bands like Sonic Youth are mislead into buying a Jandek album. His music sounds nothing like indie rock or Sonic Youth. Sure, they both use guitars with alternate tunings producing atonal rock songs. But that's where the similarity ends. Whereas Sonic Youth are an extremely tight set who undeniably have a terrific sense of melody, Jandek forgoes melody or technical skills and runs straight into the deepest recesses of loneliness and soul. Obviously Jandek is aware of current music and knows how to play his instruments, but the way he must record is so loose. He must just sit in his bedroom with a 2 track and just lie there strumming for hours, picking random notes, mumbling. This record isn't for the Britney Spears fan or the Arcade Fire fan. This record calls for someone who is completely and utterly open to the most lucid and dreamlike form of music making imaginable. Stream of conciousness rambles into the heart of someone who is just lonely and gone. This was his first album and it remains a cornerstone to the Jandek genre, he frequently covers songs from this album, borrows lyrics from it, repeats the same random noting and instruments. Indeed, this album instituted the Jandek tradition of blurry photo album covers. Jandek never strays from Jandek. Which brings me to the reason Jandek is wrongly labeled as an obscuro artist. Obviously Jandek is obscure, obviously Jandek produces works that are uncategorizable and hard to be comfortable with. But Obscuro has a level of freakishness attached to it mainly coming from other Obscuro acts like The Shaggs, or Wesley Willis. Jandek is not freakish like those acts, he doesn't have the naivete of The Shaggs, or the unpoetic grotesque of Wesley Willis. Jandek is a true outsider artist though. I could compare his artistry to Daniel Johnston, a fellow Texan. But comparing the two is wrong as they are completely different. Jandek songs border on dreamy soundscapes, whereas Daniel's songs are concise psychological rock songs. Daniel frequently uses the same subject matter for alot of his songs, whereas Jandek's songs dont really seem to have any subject matter except for his own loneliness. This listener had the honor of catching him at one of his first and only live shows in NYC, and he was terrific. Jandek is God.

120,Amazon,,"This delightful, restrained three-part BBC series is the story of eighty-five-year old Lady Slane (Wendy Hiller) whose husband, a former Viceroy of India and former British Prime Minister dies. When the story begins in 1930, Lady Slane's five children gather to discuss their mother's future. With Lord Slane deceased, there will not be enough money to maintain the splendid London mansion, so instead, the children--led by the eldest, hideously pompous son, Herbert (Graham Crowdon)--decide the house should be sold, and their mother rotated between them for short periods of time. Bossy Carrie Slane (Phyllis Calvert) thinks this is a splendid plan. Grasping son William and his avaricious wife Lavinia (Faith Brook) aren't keen on the idea--after all, it'll probably cost them some money. Gentle spinster Edith (Hilary Mason) can't wait to move into her own flat and fulfill her dream of owning a canary. Kay Slane--a determined bachelor--just doesn't want his life to be disturbed. While the arguments rage between the 'children' (they must all be in their late 50s to early 60s), Lady Slane is hatching her own plans. Herbert states that his mother has always had ""decisions made for her"" so he anticipates no argument when he reveals his plan that she should become a roving guest. But there's another side to Lady Slane that her children seem completely unaware of. Yes, she was a devoted wife and mother, but now as a widow, she sees an opportunity to finally please herself. While her children argue and imagine carving up their share of the jewelry and antiques, Lady Slane quietly and very determinedly sets out to lease a house in Hampstead--a relatively modest dwelling that she first set eyes on thirty years before. She meets the eccentric owner, Mr. Bucktrout (Maurice Denham) and arranges to move in. Based on the novel by Vita Sackville-West, ""All Passion Spent"" is an unflinching yet positive exploration of aging. All duties concluded, Lady Slane finally comes into her true self at the age of eighty-five, and stating ""I'm going to wallow in old age and be completely self-indulgent"" she refuses to allow anyone under the age of 40 to visit her in her new home (the one exception is her favourite granddaughter). In Bucktrout, Lady Slane discovers a like-minded soul--a man who says, ""Nowadays I can scarcely enjoy the company of anyone under 70."" An old admirer from Lady Slane's past--the eccentric reclusive millionaire Mr. Fitzgeorge (Harry Andrews in a marvelous performance) soon comes to call, and in their mutual old age, Fitzgeorge and Lady Slane become the very best of friends.""All Passion Spent"" is a gentle, eloquent film. There's a bittersweet thread to the story, but there are some splendid touches of light humour--mainly to be found in the behaviour of Lady Slane's children. They see their mother as a role rather than as a person, and her independent decisions seem--at least to the domineering children, Herbert, and Carrie, and the toadying William--to be signs of dementia. There's not much in the way of extras (but who cares?)--just a Sackville-West bio, and cast filmographies.

149,Amazon,,"The film ""The Official Story"" wraps the politics of government-supported torture and the slaughter of thousands of Argentinians around the awakening of the social conscience of one woman. Alicia (Norma Aleandro) is a married, affluent history teacher who works in a boys' school in Buenos Aires. She and her prominent husband, Roberto (Hector Alterio) have an adopted child, Gaby. When Alicia attends a reunion of school friends, she's delighted to see Ana (Chunchuna Villafane)--a woman who abruptly left the country seven years earlier. The atmosphere at the reunion becomes a bit tense when one woman breezily mentions that someone they all knew only has one child left. When asked what happened to the other children, the woman says--""they were all subversives."" While everyone else seems to find this a perfectly reasonable explanation, Alicia is troubled, but there's more troubling information in store. Ana reveals to Alicia that she left Argentina after being horribly tortured by military government officials who were trying to extract information about a man she once knew. Ana was lucky to survive, but she tells Alicia that there were many who didn't--including women who gave birth inside jail and had their babies stolen from them and given to the families of the privileged elite. While Alicia--who's only been vaguely aware of past social unrest--would like to reject the horrific information of her friend's treatment, prompted by her conscience she begins to question if her adopted daughter is a child of ""the Disappeared Ones"" (""Los Desaparecidos"").Alicia's brutish husband (who's outraged Ana is back in Argentina) and frivolous friends believe that torture and disappearances only happen to those who ""deserve"" it in some fashion. It takes exposure to the brutalities conducted by the state to shake Alicia out of her nice, sanitized, perfect world. As a teacher of history, she believes ""by understanding history, we understand the world,"" but she fails to realize that history is all too often an ""official"" version.  She's never questioned authority or the ""official"" versions of the past, and at the beginning of the film, she's flabbergasted when a student argues that, ""history is written by assassins.""  Slowly, she begins to connect with those around her--including a fellow teacher who explains that Alicia didn't want to believe the horrific truth because to believe murders and tortures were really happening would be to acknowledge ""complicity.""""The Official Story"" is a perfect film on every level. It's incredible to realize that so many people just 'disappeared' in Argentina between 1976-1983, and the film brings home the pain and the horror while making this a very human, moving story.

It's pretty long, lasting about twelve minutes or so, and the last two minutes are pretty much just odd sounds.2.The Widow: This one's pretty mellow compared to the first song and makes a fairly good use of the bass. Also, there's a nice guitar solo with a mixed-in trumpet solo. The last two minutes are just weird sounds but the songs only about five or so minutes.3.L'via L'viaquez:40 seconds of sound that quickly builds up to this latin-rock tune. A couple guitar solos throughout the song are featured as well as the salsa pianist Larry Harlow toward the end. It's about thirteen minutes but go ahead and skip if you want at about eleven minutes.4.Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore:4 minutes of ghost sounds and then the song begins with Cedric's amazingly high vocals. Listen to the strings and trumpet solo towards the end. I thought it was worth the wait.Cassandra Gemini:5. This one sounds like a sci-fi rock band type thing. Weird lyrics throughout the song but that goes for every other Mars Volta song.6. This song has a rather driving pulse.7. This one's short and begins with Cedric's vocals plus a repeated brass theme which blends into....8.....a riff which I believe is in 6/8 and then some more solos on guitar.9.A very repetive bass line that is by far the mellowest thing on the album that lasts about 5 minutes.10.Begins with some odd guitar sounds along with the usual recording studio knob experimentation which then begins as a three and half minute saxophone featurette.11. A brief thirty second repetition of a theme sung in #5.12.

Cedric's high vocals are a definite plus even though I think his lyrics are nonsense except for maybe a few lines throughout. I don't see why people hate his high vocals because they are still fairly good and, though odd, are the mark of a profound talent few are allowed to have. Also, Omar's guitar playing is a bit strange at times but his musical expression is so original and creative that one cannot wonder if the man is genius or just a very persistent man in his musical ability. There are times when I cannot stand certain elements of the album, but if you stick around and wait andLISTEN then you will hopefully hear something worthwhile.

Originally gaining public notice with the orchestra when he served as a last-minute replacement for an ill Arturo Toscanini in 1931, Ormandy would serve as Musical Director in Phialdelphia from 1938 until 1980.  Under his baton the Philadelphia Orchestra became known for its warm tones, textured romantic ""Philadelphia Sound,"" which is well represented on this Christmas album.  I always thought Ormandy's interpretation of Rachmaninoff was particularly strong, although I do not know enough about classical music to articulate a coherent defense of that position beyond noting that when Vladimir Horowitz played Rachmaninoff's Third Concerto on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of his Carnegie Hall debut, he picked Ormandy as the conductor of the orchestra that night.There is over an hour's worth of music here for you to enjoy if you like more of the classical approach to your Christmas music. But Ormandy's work is always marked by an ability to bring out the emotions of music being played by a symphonic orchestra.  That is why the standout tracks here are ""The Little Drummer Boy,"" ""I Wonder as I Wander,"" and ""What Child Is This?""  You would not normally think of these songs as working as well song by a chorus that by a single individual, but this album will get you to rethink your position.

131,Amazon,,"The number one question in most people's minds when they hear of Alter Bridge is; Do they sound like Creed?  The answer is no, not really.  The song that sounds most like Creed is Open Your Eyes and none of the other songs on the cd sound like Open Your Eyes.  Creed had an alternative streak (Say I, Wrong Way, etc) where as Alter Bridge sounds like straight up rock n' roll.  The guitar work on this album is VERY VERY good!  Myles Kennedy has a great voice.  He'll shock you with some of his work, for instance, his last notes on Find the Real.  Myles is a tenor and sounds very different compared to Scott Stapp.  He's actually quite a better singer than Stapp too.  Maybe a little less feel (for some people) but much better singing.  The highlights here and when I mean highlights I mean you have to hear these songs at least once in your life are;Find the Real--Great intro with double bass and solos thrown throughout each and every chorus and solo in the bridge!  Blew me away when I first heard it.  Hard and heavy but not fast.One Day Remains--More modern rock than hard rock with an alternative feel.  Very and I mean very fast verse riff with a huge flurry of notes.  Cool little sweep solo in the bridge.  It's a little repetitive but the amazing verse and anthemic chorus will have you singing along.Metallingus--Very hard and heavy and fast.  The closest thing to metal on this cd.  The bridge has a very cool start/stop heavy riff with some amazing runs thrown in.  Closes out with double bass and heavy guitars that remind me of the bridge.Broken Wings--Tremonti writes beautiful ballads and here's a darker more bleak sounding ballad than anything he's ever written.  Great bluesy fingerpicked intro with a simple verse and chorus that make you feel the MELODY sung by Myles Kennedy.  Oh, and even though the guitar work is ""simple"" it's actually quite complex with some weird sounding chords and octave chord slides that spice up the chorus without making the guitar the highlight.Shed My Skin--Softer ballad type song.  The lyrics are what really get you on this one.The End is Here--Epic and awesome.  Explodes from the verse to the chorus.  Middle Eastern sounding with again great runs and riffs.  Heavy like Find the Real in the verse (but in the chorus) and with a darker feel than Find the Real.  This is THE track on the cd.The rest of the cd is not as impressive but these tracks are amazing!  Alter Bridge definitely has a harder and heavier vibe to them then Creed did.  The cd is a mix of hard rock and a softer (but not soft) rock.  The guitar work (again) NEEDS to be heard.  This cd had me mesmerized for a couple months.  The only complaint would be that they need to follow in the vein of Find the Real and The End is Here more than Shed My Skin and a couple other tracks if they really want to do something distinctive from the TYPE of music they've made in the past.  Again every song on here is great but it sounds like Alter Bridge tried to move in one direction and then had to compromise a little (with their record label).

148,Amazon,,"Sticklers for accuracy will find this movie lacking as the paths of Jackie Robinson, Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige weren't as well intertwined as the movie suggests.  The connection with Willie Mays is an interesting, meaningful plot connection . . . and extremely hard to believe.Still, the acting and film/myth making is perfect for this most important story of ""America growing up.""  The pace of the film, keyed by a jumpy-jazz soundtrack fits with exuberance of the post-war, ""time to get moving"" era.  A cross-country automobile trip juxtaposes the new (a new class of prosperous African-Americans with their shiny automobile) with the old (not able to use a toilet in a small town).The many changes of the era are used to tell the story -- the challenge of professional baseball to stay profitable, what to do about ""negros"" (who had just fought with distinction for world democracy) made something, somehow inevitable.Josh Gibson was the great slugger (the ""Negro Babe Ruth"" he was called), although by 1946 was fading due to age and a brain tumor.  Satchel Paige was (one of?) the greatest pitcher ever and was a great box office draw.The story turns on Branch Rickey's selfish, sneaky, and noble plan to integrate baseball.  The City was right (Brooklyn - the melting pot); the politics were right (Fiorella LaGuardia appealed to minorities and Happy Chandler, the new baseball commissioner, had stated his openness to integration); the ownership was right (Rickey had played baseball on an integrated team in college); and of course, Jackie Robinson was the right man.Rickey is portrayed by the statesman-like Ed Hermann. The famous meeting where he explains to Jackie Robinson that he requires his pioneer to be strong enough to ""not fight back"" is portrayed with the subdued importance that's required.  Robinson's background (an officer in the Army, a star halfback with UCLA) is portrayed convincingly by Blair Underwood.Delroy Lindo is a bit too serious, and too devoted to his wife, not to mention possessing too broad a body, to make me believe that he's Satchel Paige.  Still, he plays the part of the superstar pitcher with the big ego that's required.I have no idea if Mykelti Williamson's portrayal of Josh Gibson is realistic, but it's delightful, poignant and ultimately tragic.Rickwood Field (Birmingham) and League Stadium (built for ""Field of their Own"" in Indiana) add another touch of colorful, enjoyable non-realism to the story.Enjoy the myth, but don't make any bar bets based on this film.",long,2521,410,good,good,neutral,"The pace of the film , keyed by a jumpy-jazz soundtrack fits with exuberance of the post-war , `` time to get moving '' era .<q>The connection with Willie Mays is an interesting , meaningful plot connection .<q>Satchel Paige was ( one of ? )","The connection with Willie Mays is an interesting , meaningful plot connection ... and extremely hard to believe.Still , the acting and film/myth making is perfect for this most important story of `` America growing up .

145,Amazon,,"By now, you've probably seen the ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" movie in a theater, or at least on DVD (if not both.) Now check out the movie's amazing soundtrack.The two major standouts of this album in my opinion are ""Journey of the Sorcerer"" and ""Vote Beeblebrox."" Anyone who's more than a casual fan of ""Hitchhiker's"" will immediately recognize ""Journey of the Sorcerer"" as the classic ""Hitchhiker's"" theme by the Eagles played on both the radio and television versions and now the movie as well. This version is enhanced and sounds great. It was a treat hearing it at the theater and it's awesome on this CD as well. ""Vote Beeblebrox"" --- I about died laughing when I heard this one. This is a sort of campaign song for Zaphod Beeblebrox that unfortunately never made it into the movie. ""Don't believe the rumors / don't believe the vicious lies"" it says, talking about how Zaphod isn't stupid. It continues in this vain with a hilarious spoken part from Zaphod saying that he ""y'know, just wants to say all the things that presidents say, y'know."" Has to be heard to be believed.Following close behind these are definitely both versions of the wondrous ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish."" Personally, I prefer the second version, a sort of upbeat lounge number, but both are great. ""So long and thanks for all the fish / So sad that it should come to this / We tried to warn you all, but oh dear.""This album also includes a couple of what I guess could called Golden Oldies --- ""Shoo-Rah! Shoo-Rah!"" and ""Here I Am (Come and Take Me)."" Of these two, I thought ""Shoo-Rah! Shoo-Rah!"" was definitely better and more fun.The bulk of the CD is the instrumental tracks from the film. Composed by Joby Talbot, these tend to suit the scenes they come from well. Enjoy some memories from the movie, or just enjoy listening to the music.Finally, one last thing to mention --- ""Reasons to be Miserable (His Name is Marvin)."" Performed by Stephen Fry, this is a redo of a song by ""Marvin himself."" Wanna know what it's like to be Marvin? ""In everything he has to do, he finds the world condemning / If he had his time again, he'd rather be a lemming.""

140,Amazon,,"This is easily one of the most unusual albums of the past few years.  One can begin with the artist's name.  Iron and Wine is one person, singer-songwriter-guitarist-banjoist Sam Beam, and this, his first album, was recorded in his own home under his own direction.  I have read that Beam sent the tape to a record company as more or less a demo tape, but Sub Pop decided to bring it out as an album just as it was.  The lone criticism of the album is that it truly does sound like something recorded at home.  Though it is never less than utterly enchanting, the sound is just slightly muddy throughout.  If one compares the sound of THE CREEK DRANK THE CRADLE with Beam's follow up album, OUR ENDLESS NUMBERED DAYS, the contrast is sharp.  I can understand the record company's hesitancy to rerecord to improve the sonic quality of the cuts:  though sonically not as sharp as one would like, the songs are absolutely perfect as performed.  How could one improve on the wistful rhythm of the astonishing ""Upward over the Mountain,"" in which the singer utters words meant to comfort his mother, a gorgeous slide guitar creating an arch between verses?  There are four things that I think makes Sam Beam one of the great artists working in the US today.  First, he is an absolutely masterful songwriter, crafting exquisitely delicate songs with marvelously poetic lyrics.  I'm undecided as to whether I prefer the lyrics or the melodies of his songs.  He is capable of great poetry.  For instance, in ""Bird Stealing Bread,"" the singer laments the loss of an ex-girlfriend and in thinking of her new love asks her:Do his hands in your hairFeel a lot like a thingYou believe in?Or a bit like a birdStealing breadOut from under your nose?Second, Beam possesses a voice of great beauty characterized by a wonderful purity and softness.  He seems incapable of singing roughly.  Third, as an arranger of his own songs, he displays a perfect touch.  He has a great gift for keeping them as simple as possible, and there isn't a single one that I would like to see even slightly embellished.  Finally, he is a talented guitarist, but he constrains his playing to call as little attention to his skills and as much attention to the songs as possible.  He exercises restraint so that the songs are always at the forefront.Based on THE CREEK DRANK THE CRADLE and OUR ENDLESS NUMBERED DAYS, there is no performer today I'd rather see a new album by.  Many will compare him with artists like Sebadoh or Nick Drake, but for me you do him a disservice by comparing him to anyone else, even very good performers",long,2594,456,neutral,good,good,"Iron and Wine is one person , singer-songwriter-guitarist-banjoist Sam Beam , and this , his first album , was recorded in his own home under his own direction .<q>He is capable of great poetry .<q>I have read that Beam sent the tape to a record company as more or less a demo tape , but Sub Pop decided to bring it out as an album just as it was .","This is easily one of the most unusual albums of the past few years .

117,Amazon,,"The great dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf herself said about Wilhelm Furtwangler that he was the greatest conductor who ever lived.  The soprano quoted that Furtwangler knew how to make the music flow...that he made the music live.  Yehudi Menuhin, the great Jewish violinist, praised Furtwangler as the one conductor who knew how to shape music into a fluid--a feat that Furtwangler could do so well without resorting into shaping static, solid phrases of music.  Werner Tharichen, a long time timpanist of the Berlin Philharmonic, had this to say about Furtwangler.  ""One day I was sitting beside my timpani while a guest conductor was reheasing...Suddenly the sound changed.  There was warmth and intensity as if everything were at stake.  Astonished, I looked up from my score to seee if some new baton acrobatism had brought about this miracle.   But it was still the same conductor.  I looked at my colleagues.  They were all staring at the door at the far end of the hall.  There stood Furtwangler.  His mere presence suffered to draw those sounds from the orchestra.""Imaginative...fluid, and lyrical.  Sublime, passionate, erotic...rapture...these mere words fail to express the beauty that shrouds this recording of Tristan und Isolde.  For many years, I have held out on this recording due to my thought that Karajan's Tristan was supreme over Furtwangler's.  I was not mistakened, for stereo, Jon Vickers, Christa Ludwig, and a youthful Dernesch all made K's Tristan a wonder to behold.  Then, I put this record back onto my player, and before I knew it I was enraptured by the sweet music flowing from Act II.  Furtwangler really knew how to conduct Wagner's most passionate score, and without a doubt his Tristan is supreme over others in interpretation of music.Kirsten Flagstad sings Isolde in this recording.  She has distilled this Isolde from the many years she has performed it, and it is indeed a golden one.  It may sound matronly at first, but you tend to overlook this once you are swept away by Furtwangler's greatness.  Ludwig Suthaus is an amazing heldentenor, one of the most beautiful voices to take on the role after Domingo's brilliant Tristan with Pappano.  Blanche Thebom, like a former reviewer said, is the perfect foil to Flagstad's outstanding Isolde, and the young Fischer-Dieskau complements the role of Kurwenal perfectly. While I prefer the realistic ages at which the Karajan cast is captured, this seasoned cast bares the psychology of the characters perfectly.  If only Christa Ludwig were cast as Brangane, this recording would have been perfect.  If mono sound isn't for you though, I'd recommend Karajan's recording...or if you prefer a faster one with great quality to boot, Pappano's recording.  I have to say this, but I really dislike Bohm's recording of Tristan.  It lacks the lackluster sublime transcendent quality that other Tristans bring to the role.  I would even recommend Kleiber and Bernstein over Bohm's recording.  Once Bernstein's recording is rereleased in amazon.com, I urge you by all means to purchase that one.  It may be long, but it is a meditative recording with a most wonderful Isolde in Hildegard Behrens, a nicest Brangane in Yvonne Minton, and a passionate Tristan in Peter Hofmann.  He may sound lacking for the role, but I don't think Bernstein would have had it in him to record this great opera with a mediocre singer.  He really suits the part well.Of course, for a first Tristan...you must turn to Furtwangler.

119,Amazon,,"It really is a shame that John Arthur Martinez didn't win the ""Nashville Star"" competition.  Not to steal any of Buddy Jewell's thunder, but Martinez seems to be a more talented writer, singer, and artist.  But obviously the folks in Nashville wanted a star that they could mold into their perfect creation.  Jewell has that whole Travis Tritt meets Waylon Jennings thing going for him.  He also has a sound with larger demographic appeal, so it doesn't surprise me that he was picked instead of Martinez.  Believe me, I'm glad for Jewell, but I think that Martinez is the better all-around artist. Martinez doesn't fit the mold that Nashville is looking for.  Had he given in to the wishes of Music City, he'd be singing about dancin' in the bed of an ol' Ford with his redneck girl.  Then he'd watch a little NASCAR and drink a little Jim Beam with his buddies at the bar.  Instead, he embraces his heritage, faith, and home state whole-heartedly.He'll never draw the big crowds of bubbly girls like a Tim McGraw or a Kenny Chesney.  He won't write a song like ""Save A Horse, Ride A Cowboy"" that'll end up as a vinyl sticker on the back of some idiot's truck.  Instead, he'll probably be the guy content with writing great songs like ""The Man Who Holds The Bow"" and ""Lone Starry Night.""  In other words, Martinez writes songs from the heart about the things that are important to him.  Judging by this album, those things include his aforementioned faith, heritage, and the great state of Texas.If any of these songs have commercial potential, I'd have to say that ""The River Of Love/El Rio Amor"" and ""The Man Who Holds The Bow"" are definite winners.  ""El Rio Amor"" would have given Marty Robbins a run for his money back in Robbins' heyday.  The rest of this album is loaded with great, true-to-the-heart songs that give you an insight into the thoughts and feelings of Martinez.  My favorite song on the album is ""A Girl Named Texas.""  If you know anything about Texas artists, you can picture this song being sung by a guy like Gary P. Nunn.  It reminded me of Nunn's ""What I Like About Texas.""  ""Home Made Of Stone"" and ""Trouble Rides A Fast Horse"" are two of my other favorites.Martinez covers ""Amarillo By Morning,"" which we all know George Strait turned into a hit.  I like Martinez' version, but he really shines brighter on his original work.  I must say that the accordian was a nice touch to ""Amarillo,"" though.  ""The Armadillo Song"" has bar-song written all over it.  It would sound great if you gathered up a few drunks at the bar and challenged them to sing it.  I slip and studder through it, and that's when I'm sober.  It also would probably appeal to children(I know my three year-old shook her rump to it).Martinez throws a little Spanish into some of the songs, which I love.  Unfortunately, Nashville looks down on expressing ethnicity.  Guys like the Texas Tornados, Los Lobos, BeauSoleil, and, to a lesser extent, acts like the Mavericks and JoEl Sonnier, are ten times better than most of the acts that are bringing in the big bucks these days, but because they embrace their heritage, they'll always be considered ""regional acts.""  That's ashame, but it's also a good thing because we get to keep the best artists to ourselves.So if you love your country music with a little Tex-Mex flavor or if you enjoy artists like the late Marty Robbins, this album is for you.  If you enjoy artists with a ""regional"" flavor like Gary P. Nunn, buy this album.  Or if you simply enjoy great songs performed by the guy who actually WROTE them, get this disc.I highly recommend it",long,3592,635,neutral,neutral,suboptimal,"It really is a shame that John Arthur Martinez did n't win the `` Nashville Star '' competition .<q>Not to steal any of Buddy Jewell 's thunder , but Martinez seems to be a more talented writer , singer , and artist .<q>Martinez does n't fit the mold that Nashville is looking for .","It really is a shame that John Arthur Martinez did n't win the `` Nashville Star '' competition .

118,Amazon,,"I was one of the lucky people who got to see the television show of this album. Remembering that this was before MTV, seeing someone that was considered to be somewhat of a rebel and counterculture on television at that time was incredible. Naturally I ran out and bought the (vinyl) album.What an album this is. Not quite like his previous albums, ""Nightmare"" had a few softer touches, most notably ""Only Women Bleed,"" a song about how women in general at that time were considered second class citizens.There are more highlights. ""The Black Widow"" has a narrated opening by the incomparable Vincent Price, preceding Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" by quite a few years. My general rule of thumb is that just about anything that Vincent Price ever did on vinyl is excellent, and this narration is perfect for the album and as a lead-in to the song.Listen to the end of ""Department of Youth"" cranked up really loud. As the sound is fading Alice Cooper asks the children who has the power, they answer that they do.  Alice then asks who gave them the power, with the expectation that it would be Alice Cooper. The children answer ""Donny Osmond,"" setting Alice into a frenzy; a hilarious fadeout.""The Awakening"" is a bit of a chiller that implies the singer has killed his wife. This song is all seriousness, and one of the best songs on the CD.""Cold Ethyl"" is pure laughs; macabre laughs yes, but laugh nonetheless. Cold Ethyl is his lover, but she's cold because she's dead and in the refrigerator. As long as you can handle the subject, the song should make you smile.""Devil's Food"" and ""Stephen"" have some rocking moments more characteristic of Alice Cooper, and are both good as well.""Some Folks"" and ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" are both good.  Each has a mainstream feel to the music though the lyrics are anything but. Perhaps Alice was trying for the contrast between the lyrics and music to give the songs a bit of surrealism. Both songs are enjoyable.""Years Ago"" has Alice talking in a little boy voice in a song that implies something sinister. The song is okay and somewhat unique, but really provides the lead-in to ""Stephen."" While ""Years Ago"" might put you off a little at first, listening to it and then ""Stephen"" you realize that the two go together, almost as part I and II of the same song.""Escape"" caps off the album. ""Escape"" was always a puzzler for me, because it seems to be a bit out of step with the rest of the album. Partially it's due to the lyrics:""Where am I running to,There's no place to go.Just put on my makeup,and get me to the show.""The way Alice sings these lyrics sounds more like The Beatles than Alice. It's good, but unlike Alice.Note that this version of this album is the 1990 release.  There is a later release that has bonus tracks.  I think the bonus tracks are worth having, but that version was a lot more expensive at the time of this review.  You should survey the versions available and choose the one that best meets your needs.The 70s was such a great time for unique albums, and this one was one of those. I've listened to this album dozens of times. I hope I'm listening to it 20 (or 30) years from now. Alice was such a character with a lot of talent to entertain, sometimes amuse.

108,Amazon,,"This is, hands down, the best dog training DVD available today.  Paul Owens bases his entire approach to dog training on a philosophy of nonviolence, which means not causing any physical, emotional, or psychological harm to your dog.  What a relief for those of us who are tired of being told to bully or ""dominate"" our dogs!  The training exercises that Owens explains and demonstrates work wonderfully at producing a dog who is cooperative and enthusiastic about responding to requests, without any yelling or jerking of chains or grabbing and shaking.  I don't WANT to do that to my dog, and Owens shows how you don't HAVE to do that in order to have a dog who fits in as a well behaved member of a human family.What's unique about this DVD is that it combines the sound scientific principles behind ""reward-based"" training with a philosophical approach that draws on yoga and other Eastern disciplines.  Reward-based training uses techniques that reward the dog for doing ""good"" behavior, and witholds rewards when the dog doesn't do the good behavior.  It sets up a situation in which dogs enjoy doing the things you ask of them.  On the other hand, the breathing techniques that Owens demonstrates have a concrete effect on the way your dog reacts.  They really work!  I have calmed down my barking dog many times, simply by changing the way I breathe.Seven years ago, I read Owens' book THE DOG WHISPERER, and this DVD takes up nicely where the book left off.  The advantage to the DVD is that you get to see the training exercises actually demonstrated.  I also appreciate the fact that you can go directly to the exercise you would like to work on by choosing from the menu, without having to rewind or fast forward.This should NOT be confused with Cesar Millan's DOG WHISPERER television series.  Cesar Millan uses very different methods, including choke chains, etc.  I think it's unfortunate that Millan chose to use the name of a book that was published long before Millan ever appeared on TV.  Paul Owens is the original Dog Whisperer.As a bonus, the DVD starts with a cartoon that made me laugh my head off.  It captured so well the way stress around the household can escalate to a boiling point, and how we relate to our dogs in both good and bad ways because of it.  It made me both recognize and laugh at myself.Overall, the DVD is very accessible and fun, and works well as an introduction to training for the whole family--kids as well as adults",long,2466,431,neutral,neutral,good,"Paul Owens bases his entire approach to dog training on a philosophy of nonviolence , which means not causing any physical , emotional , or psychological harm to your dog .<q>Paul Owens is the original Dog Whisperer.As a bonus , the DVD starts with a cartoon that made me laugh my head off .<q>Reward-based training uses techniques that reward the dog for doing `` good '' behavior , and witholds rewards when the dog does n't do the good behavior .","Paul Owens bases his entire approach to dog training on a philosophy of nonviolence , which means not causing any physical , emotional , or psychological harm to your dog .

115,Amazon,,"I travel a lot with my job, so having 2 cats wasn't always easy. I could leave them a big bowl of food and water, and have someone check on them every 3-4 days or so, but litter was a problem. I got my first Littermaid about 10 years ago. I have since bought 2 more. The reviews below are correct, DO NOT rinse the electric portion of the box. Littermaid has made several improvements over the years, such as a completely detachable top instead of having to slide only the bottom tray in and out like before. I did learn my lesson not to spray the electric part, that one I replaced myself. The motors seem to have improved over the last few models, and I highly recommend the Littermaid Mega for 2 cats or more. The motor on my second one went bad though, and instead of paying for a 3rd one, I called Littermaid. I got through immediately, they were extremely nice and helpful, and exceeded my expectations. They simply asked me to cut the cord and send it, along with a couple of other things, and a $15 check. My replacement was in the mail before I could even mail all that stuff out myself!I have tried the Purrforma by Petmate, and was so disappointed within the first couple of days I sent it back.I didn't know about a ""cord that provides more juice"" as stated in a review below, but I would recommend it and am going to check into it myself. However, like I said, over the years Littermaid has made constant improvements and I have had absolutely no problems whatsoever with my latest unit they sent to replace my last one, so the ""juicier cord"" is not really necessary. As stated in other reviews, you just have to be careful not to overfill. I have almost NEVER had to remove poop from the tines, if I did I just used the edge of the regular pooper scooper to knock it back down into the litter. I also use the lining the scoop tray with a bag method. I purchase the smallest (4 gallon) bags at your grocery store, and the scented kind really help! I wouldn't buy the bags made for litterboxes, they're too big and WAY too expensive. A small box of 4 gallon trash bags costs me around $2.50 for 10-20 bags or more. As for litter getting all around the edge of the box, that is true. To avoid that I simply purchased a large mat or rug. I think I paid $5 at Dollar General or something. Make sure it is large enough to extend at least 6 inches from the side of the litterbox, and in front of the paw cleaning ramp. So, when I'm vacuuming I use my upholstery attachment to vacuum around it; or if I'm not vacuuming I just move the litterbox over, roll the mat up, take it outside and shake it off--that does the trick. I put the box in my laundry room so now I can't hear it and because it's pretty well ventilated I don't smell the litter at all.Take care of it, read the instructions, and don't be an idiot and you'll love the Littermaid",long,2849,545,good,good,good,"Littermaid has made several improvements over the years , such as a completely detachable top instead of having to slide only the bottom tray in and out like before .<q>I got my first Littermaid about 10 years ago .<q>The reviews below are correct , DO NOT rinse the electric portion of the box .","The reviews below are correct , DO NOT rinse the electric portion of the box .

135,Amazon,,"I've found this album getting some really mixed reviews, which is quite mind-blowing. Unless you're a total Bon Scott worshipper who refuses to give Brian Johnson his due, which of course is a big mistake, no hard rock lover should be without this album.Originally released in September of 1990, ""The Razors Edge"" smokes and kicks major ass all over the place--you've got to take your hat off to the late Bruce Fairbairn for his production on this one. Much has been made that Brian Johnson's voice sounds totally shot on here.  Admittedly, by this time, he no longer had the kind of gloriously piercing edge that you can hear in full force on 1981's ""For Those About To Rock..."" and 1983's ""Flick of the Switch"".  On the other hand, he's still singing his balls off on here in his usual high-pitched register, and he adds greatly to the album's excitement level.  There's a certain on-the-edge intensity to his vocals here that really gets under your skin.The big hit ""Thunderstruck"", with its classic single-string lead guitar line from Angus Young, gets the album off to a great anthemic start. ""Fire Your Guns"" is one of those thrilling fast-paced AC/DC gems that really gets the blood flowing. ""Money Talks"" has something of a barroom rock quality, but don't worry, it's hardly Hootie & the Blowfish, and it's got an incredibly catchy chorus. The arrestingly menacing title track is chillingly powerful. For proof positive that Angus and Malcolm Young are kings of hard rock riffery, you needn't look any further than the stomping ""Got You By The Balls""--the main riff is uncanny: deceptively simple and absolutely bone-crunching. The album closes in intensely menacing fashion with the ingeniously crafted stomper ""If You Dare"". There's a load more excitement to be found as well with the driving ""Rock Your Heart Out""; the chugging ""Shot Of Love""; and a pair of good-timey party rockers: ""Are You Ready"" and ""Let's Make It"". Showing what a roll the boys are on, even the tracks that seem filler-ish work--the 'sleigh bells'-fortified ""Mistress For Christmas"" is amusingly dumb and irresistibly fun; and ""Goodbye And Good Riddance To Bad Luck"", with its utterly tossed off main riff, is also solidly amusing and enjoyable.Metaphorically speaking, the boys are simply on fire here, and the album is thoroughly a blast.

122,Amazon,,"This is a great movie.  The time: immediately following the Second World War.  The place: Scotland, specifically the Scotts Highland Regiment.  The Regiment has returned from hard combat in North Africa and Europe, and once again is esconced in its barracks in the Scottish Highlands--the place in which it has been headquartered for over three hundred years.  The Acting Commanding Officer is Col. Jock Sinclair (Alec Guiness), a rough, uneducated man from the lower classes who worked his way up to Colonel from the ranks.  Sinclair got his promotion in the desert, fighting Rommel, and one senses that these experiences have created strong bonds of friendship between Sinclair and certain other officers in the battalion.  Now higher headquarters has assigned a new Commanding Officer to the battalion--Col. Basil Barrow, a university-educated man from the upper classes who comes from a long line of officers who served with, and indeed commanded, the battalion.  But Barrow, for all that, is viewed as an outsider and newcomer--while the other officers forged friendships in the war, fighting the Germans, Barrow was in the Pacific theater.  Sinclair is relegated to second-in-command.  Sinclair is deeply resentful of Barrow, and immediately gets off on the wrong foot with his new commander, unintentionally belittling Barrow's war service, most of which involved the horrors of being a POW tortured by the Japanese.  In fact, Colonel Barrow is deeply scarred by his wartime experience, and has lost perspective in dealing with his officers.  He is a martinet, and appears to forget that leadership involves earning the respect of one's subordinates--it is not simply bestowed from on-high.  Although both men love the Regiment above all else, this film is about an implacable conflict between Sinclair and Barrow.  For Sinclair does not respect Barrow, who he views as a ""spry wee gent who will not command the Battalion for very long...""The interaction between Barrow and Sinclair provides for an intense psychological confrontation.  This is a war movie without a war.  None is needed.  This is a superb study in leadership, confrontation, loyalty, and the nature of the tradition-rich Highland Regiment.  The class divisions among the Regimental officers is interestingly portrayed.  The entire cast turns in a fine performance, and Guiness is truly stellar as the rough-spoken Colonel Sinclair.The DVD is beautifully remastered, with crisp audio and video.

And, ironically enough, they were both conceived by ""mad man"" Mel Brooks whose humor is definitely left of center. I think you are either a Mel Brooks fan or you're not. Now, it is true that some of Mel Brooks movies are funnier than others and this is his funniest movie with Blazing Saddles being a very close second.The scene I loved the most is when ""the monster"" visits the blind man. Oh my, God, Peter Boyle's expressions are positively priceless. And if you don't already know, the blind man is played by Gene Hackman, and if you didn't know, where have you been...in a friggin' closet? I mean the movie is almost 32 years old which means I am almost 42 years old! Good God!I also love the parts with Madeline Khan and Kenneth Mars. I love the whole movie! It's just too good. I think what makes this movie absolutely brilliant was Brooks decision to film it in black and white and use a lot of the same techniques that James Wale used to create the original Frankenstein. Did you know that the studio execs originally wern't going to back up the film unless Mel Brooks changed his mind and made it in color, instead? Proof positive that just because you may be in a ""high ranking"" position, you don't always know what you're talking about.

I am glad she made the decision to replace our slowly deteriorating VHS copy of Young Frankenstein with the DVD version.I do like the extras even though there weren't that many, but you have to take in account that they probably didn't have much footage from back then because this was in the mid 70s and they didn't think that they needed to have all of it saved for future use which is kind of sad when you think about it because they were making a classic and it would've been nice to have a documented record to go along with the movie, but this was long before computer technology and the like really kicked in. Now they have a behind the scenes look at every movie ever made. No, thank you, I don't want to see the doc based on ""Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties""...So. yeah, get this incredible movie.

From Dazed & Confused, until stairway to heaven, Jimmy page has always been one of my greatest Guitar heroes. I thought I've actually heard White summer & Moby Dick, and I have seen the ""The song remains the same"" Movie.I've had a couple of Zepp live CD's. I thought I knew how They have sounded on stage, I thought I knew what they were about.well I was wrong. I was not only blown away By this DVD SET, I figured out I had still much to learn and listen with regards to Led zeppelin, and the related genres. for the first time I truly heard White Summer and Moby dick, for the first time I've heard and seen them as they were truly on stage (Brilliant remaster Job!), I suddenly realized why the guitar teacher I've had two years earlier, kept insisting that LZ II was much better than LZ IV... well it really doesn't matter which is better (silly argument, Huh?), but I've seen his point.LZ II and LZ IV are still my LZ favs, but my conception of LZ would never be the same.""I can't quit you babe"" appears here in the best performance I have heard, and sounds much better here than on the studio Version.Dazed and confused is even more amazing. you get a large portion, if not a complete one, of every important Zepp Concert that has survived.you also get some quite rare stuff from 1969, in fine quality, some in colour! The best feature undoubtedly is the complete Albert Hall 1970 gig.Stairway to heaven is from a different gig than the ""song remains"" DVD.You DO get here more than half of the live stuff, from the old movie.IMHO, ""The song remains the same"" is not bad at all, but it is nothing compared to this! In fact, they complete each other.So, if you really want to see Led zeppelin in Live form, want only one LZ Live DVD, are a rock fan and/or blues fan, get this as soon as you are able!if you are a true hardcore Zeppelin fan, or if insist having it all, get them both, but I guarantee that you would place this set in your player a lot more than the old movie,. eventually only obsessive fans would watch the old one regularly (No offence, simply being honest).Any Led Zeppelin Fan, who doesn't purchase this DVD set, either has a problem in basic thought or emotion, or has a completely empty pocket.Every track here is an experience.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",long,3152,569,good,suboptimal,good,"The YB 's first lead guitarist , Eric Clapton , the YB 's third and final Guitarist , Jimmy Page , and one African American guitar player which arrived to the UK ( Jimmy Hendrix , who else ?<q>I thought I 've actually heard White summer & Moby Dick , and I have seen the `` The song remains the same '' Movie.I 've had a couple of Zepp live CD 's .<q>In 1964 , the Yardbirds went Famous .",", all played this new kind of loud and crazy blues ... well it started pretty mild , with R&B such as The cover for Johnny Lee Hooker 's `` Louise '' ...

199,Amazon,,"First of all, Angie Everheart can't act her way out of a paper bag. The person who did the casting for this movie should be fired immediately. I wanna hope they weren't serious. I mean, this has to be a comedy..right? This is a disagrace to vampire movies everywhere and has ultimately led to the destruction of the ""Tales from the Crypt"" movie legacy. ""Tales from the Crypt"" was one of the most legendary shows, in my opinion, of all time. It was full of irony, deceit, horror, and revenge. There was always one lesson to be learned, and that's people always get what they deserve in the end. Needless to say, the thought of a ""Tales from the Crypt"" movie excited me, and after ""Demon Knight"" was so good, I expected this to be even better. Thus, leading to more films. I was SERIOUSLY MISTAKEN! This movie was absolutely horrible. Chris Sarandon has the most laughable character of all as the T.V Evangelist/Preacher. I was very disappointed in him after the sexy and seductive vampire he played in ""Fright Night"" which is also another favorite of mine. I guess he's kinda taking what he can get right now, but I would have never guessed that he was hard up enough to make a complete fool out of himself. The same goes for Corey Feldman. Obviously, the lesser talented of the 2 Corey's, he also blew big time in this movie too. After being in ""The Lost Boys"" I thought I was a fan forever, but once again...I THOUGHT WRONG! He was in this movie all of 3 scenes which are equivalent to about 10 minutes in all probably..if that. On top of that, who owed Angie Everheart a favor? because she had the worst role of all in the film. She clearly got this role because of how she looks because her acting level is flat at 0 (zero). Come on, Her voice stayed exactly the same throught the duration of the movie. It kept the same tone and everything, there was no enthusiam, no passion, no sex appeal, no charisma, and often at times it sounded very flat and mechanical like she was reading directly from que cards. Next, we have Erika Eleniak, who is clearly in the same boat with Chris Sarandon and Corey Feldman. I genuinely don't think she's a bad actress, but she just gets caught up in bad roles. I guess there needs to be a ""Baywatch Reunion"" soon because that was definitely when she shined most. Don't even get me started on Dennis Miller, he couldn't be funny if he tried. Not to mention, his acting is mediocre at best. This movie looks like one big joke that got dumber and dumber along the way. That goes double for the scene when they go into the ""Bordello"" to slay the prostitute vampires....PUHLEEZE! Maybe, if it were a spoof it would've been better. What was the point of even showing us the key from ""Demon Knight"" if it had absolutely nothing to do with the movie? I was thinking they were about to elaborate more on the key, or at least the origin...I THOUGHT WRONG! The key played no part in this at all. Next, a vampire brothel..I wonder who's bright idea that was because they person needs to be found immediately and fired. That's the best they could do? They start off by having some guy with a serious case of the shakes, and who looks and acts seriously disturbed meet these guys in a bar/poolhall and tell them all about how and where they can have the best sex of all time, give them the address of where to go, and these fools actually go. If you're gonna be that dumb, then you deserve to be eaten by vampires.

The disadvantages of these games are largely overcome in Shout about Movies.This game is fast-paced, diverse, and generally well-conceived. The variety of questions and the creativity in presentation make this game tons of fun.I have played with large groups (7-10 people) whose movie knowledge ranges from movie buff to casual viewer, and although there were some who were frustrated because they didn't perform as well as other players, everyone had at least a couple questions where they were the first to shout out the answer to and, most importantly, everyone had fun.Everything is handled by the DVD interface. I particularly like the way it keeps score. The first time we played, we assumed that we would have to remember how many points each team scored during the 10-question rapid-fire rounds. But to our pleasant surprise, after each round it complete the DVD does a question-by-question re-cap and asks which team answered it correctly. This actually enhanced enjoyment quite a bit since not only did we not have to count answers during the actually game play, it also gave the group a chance to relive the excitement that occurred when shouting out answers.The game can only be used three times, which is disappointing (hence my durability score). But when we thought about it, for about $20 our group of seven had over two hours of excellent entertainment for the evening. In our case the choices on the table were a) all go out for dinner (very interactive, at least $8/person, probably much more)b) all go to a movie (no interaction between group members, about $8/person)c) play Shout about Movies (very interactive, and about $3/person)So it seems pricey, but when compared to these entertainment options it really isn't that bad.

170,Amazon,,"For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't.This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come. Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. ""A Christmas Story"" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers. Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of ""odd fellow"" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man). I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately.The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to ""cling"" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table. Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again. The audience bought it up... too bad. You don't need to feel ashamed to say it really isn't as special as it tries to present itself as. Oh well, perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film. Here is the film's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer... I sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as ""unhelpful"" because they disagree with it (then again, that's the style on Amazon these days isn't it?)",long,2840,506,good,good,neutral,"Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas ( how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there ?<q>Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films , but at the same time they 'd like an anime feel to their films ... what 's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing , creative , and powerful .<q>Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation ?","This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it is n't .

168,Amazon,,"SO, here again!  This is just another Columbia Tristar's straght-to-video film, which, if you know what I mean, a pretty bad sign.  However, if you see such names as Gena Gershon and Dwight Yoakam, you might hope this is something better than usual trashes.  Sorry, '3 Way' is as bad as you can imagine, utterly thrill-free modern noir, which has no sense of suspence.  And Gena Gershon's role is a very small one!The plot is based on one book of which title I forgot.  Anyway, it's about 'Lew' (Dominic Purcell), who happens to overhear the conversations about kidnap plans.  After identifying the would-be criminals, Lew thinks of intercepting all the money to himself.  Then, we are told that Lew has a girlfriend named Rita (Joy Bryant), who may or may not be a reliable partner in their own crime.  This not-so-exciting story gets more complicated by one quiet-mannered man Herbert, who thinks of different plans of getting easy money from Lew, whose unfaithful wife, I almost forgot to tell you, was supposed dead, or killed, which was shown in the pre-credit scenes.Complicated, isn't it?  Or called it muddled if you like.  As this is a film noir, any complex plot can be excused as long as you get what you see in good noirs -- plots clever enough to be manipulating our (or the characters') minds, and convincing atomosphere.  But you get none of them.  For the film is hopelessly flat.  When the character finds out the owner of a car by stumbling upon the same bumper sticker at a shop (really), you should start to worry.  When the 'good memories about the life with my wife' are expressed with flashbacks showing a man and a woman running on the beach, both smiling and hugging each other, you better push the fast-forward button.In addition to Purcell and Bryant, Ali Larter and Desmond Harrington appear, none of whom can save the mess.  And Ms. Gershon's role is so small that you might not notice that she is there.  And except Dwight Yoakam, who is a real professional and shows what a pro can do with cool, subdued performance, all the acting is what you can call blatantly mediocre, or simply bad.My advice: don't watch.

193,Amazon,,"With all due respect to the director of Adventures in Babysitting, Chris Colombus, he helped create one of the most racist films in American cinematic history.Is it well crafted?  Yes.  Is the acting okay?  Yes.  Does it move along?  Heck, just like a windup toy.But please consider the plot: A white girl (Elizabeth Shue, lightyears from her work in Leaving Las Vegas) is baby-sitting several white kids, when she gets a desperate phone call from her white girl friend.  Why is her white girl friend desperate?  Because she is stuck in a downtown bus station, surrounded by (gasp) African Americans!Naturally, Shue races off, baby-sitting kids in tow, to rescue her friend from this tragic situation.  Maybe she should have called Jesse Jackson first, eh?When Shue gets downtown, various amusing adventures ensue.  But how can it be ignored that each of the adventures involves meeting someone who lives in the inner city who is African American.  And every single African American she meets is a criminal.  There is only one exception: (are you ready?  'spoiler' ahead!): the African Americans who sing and dance!Colombus must have been very disappointed that Steppin Fetchit (who adopted that stage name as a joke) was not alive and could not appear in his film.There is one African American who helps Shue and who does not sing and dance.  (Spoiler ahead) I kept hoping he would turn out to be an undercover cop.  But, no, he was a car thief.It would appear that Mr. Colombus is not aware of any non-singing, non-dancing African Americans who are not thieves, thugs or crooks.The film is a disgrace.  Really.  The fact that it is well produced makes it even worse--it can not be written off as a cheapy done by people who did not know better.  For anyone who has seen Mr. Colombus' other films, however, the racism of this film should come as no surprise.  ""Home Alone"" was set in a similarly all white world (there was a single African American with a speaking part of a few lines, and no other non-white cast members).  Even in J.R. Rowling's Harry Potter series, which devoted a great amount of time to racism issues (between 'muggles' and magic practitioners, a brilliant symbolic foray into racism by Rowling), Colombus managed to dilute her anti-racism message. Look at the first two Harry Potter films, which he directed: multi-cultural England in Colombus' hands becomes an almost entirely all white country.  Only after Colombus leaves the series do non-white actors get a chance.This film should not be praised.  It should be held up as an example of cultural bias and racism.I generally do not write negative reviews, but this film has been given a 'free ride' for way too long by American film critics.  But they are the same critics who praise 'Gone With the Wind', a four hour film about the civil war which does not once mention the word 'slave'.  The racism of 'Gone With The Wind' has been ignored by most reviewers.  It took a long time for me to realize how racist it was.

151,Amazon,,"I purchased this Vantec product and used it for a short time.  Most USB enclosures offer ""heat dissipation thru the metal case"", as does this one. However, I grew very concerned about how hot the Vantec became, especially after active operation. Heat is a major enemy of electrical motors. The HDD obviously just cooks inside the Vantec. There is also a definitive  difference between its temperature in stand-by mode, and during/immediately after active use. I found another USB enclosure offering active ventilation: the Apricorn EZ Bus DT, which not only has a built-in fan, but IMHO, for several critical reasons, is a better design and a smarter choice.  Here is why: The Apricorn's 3-inch diameter fan is mounted transversely, so it pulls heat directly off the entire underside of the HDD and expels thru vents on either end of the case. In comparison, the Vantec's internal chassis has a solid metal plate which covers the entire HDD circuit board (see the image I loaded above).  The Vantec has no venting, so the heat inside builds up fast. I installed a 500GB HDD in the Apricorn and ran a 220+GB backup from the Vantec. Upon completion hours later, the Apricorn's exterior was completely cool to the touch; the Vantec's exterior was REALLY HOT.A couple of other things I found superior about the Apricorn: It's heavier with a wider base, compared to the Vantec's (3"" vs. 1.5""). When mounted vertically, you can nudge the Vantec (or the desk it's sitting on) and it will fall over; it happened twice in the few days I used it. There would be major motion required to tip the Apricorn, and I've never toppled it in months of use. The Apricorn's easy-action pushbutton power switch is conveniently (and sensibly) located on the front of the unit. The Vantec's is on the bottom of the rear panel (see photo above), but it's a stiff toggle-type switch and awkward to operate. You have to hold the Vantec down with one hand firmly in order to get enough leverage to operate the balky switch... and you leave a nice handprint on the case, which then has to be cleaned. Do that a few times and the sexy ""mirror finish"" isn't going to look new for very long. Also, the Vantec's internal PC board HDD cable is mounted off-center on from the socket on any HDD. You have to kink the Vantec's flat cable in order to complete the connection (see photo above). The Apricorn's is located exactly in line with the HDD's connector, and requires no stressing of the cable. The Apricorn is available here on Amazon, but I found it for less at Page Computers. It is slightly higher in cost than the Vantec, but I'm convinced it is a much better product. Also, with Apricorn's active ventilation and greater physical stability, I have peace of mind about the longevity & safety of the expensive drive mounted inside it",long,2807,491,good,good,neutral,"I found another USB enclosure offering active ventilation : the Apricorn EZ Bus DT , which not only has a built-in fan , but IMHO , for several critical reasons , is a better design and a smarter choice .<q>Here is why : The Apricorn 's 3-inch diameter fan is mounted transversely , so it pulls heat directly off the entire underside of the HDD and expels thru vents on either end of the case .<q>I installed a 500GB HDD in the Apricorn and ran a 220+GB backup from the Vantec .","Heat is a major enemy of electrical motors .

197,Amazon,,"I like every actor/actress in this movie that I know of and I really tried to like it, but if a movie ever needed gratuitous nude scenes this was the one, but alas it had but one short meaningless nude scene performed by a unknown and it was her only scene. Sadly that was one of the films highlights. Now I say that because if it had few nude scenes thrown in here and there then the film would be at least veiwable or have fleeting moments of sophmoric humor ... somewhat. It did have a plot, a very weak, very predicable plot that left no room for surprises or guess work unless perhaps you are a little challenged mentally. The surprise ending was lackluster and overall a very poor effort for those involved. It did have Taylor Negron who as a rule is pretty funny, but I'm guessing the budget on this movie was so low that they couldn't afford to pay him to talk as he played a mute and Matt Winston said all his lines. The scenes with Matt Winston (Gerd) and Taylor Negron (Gunther) offered a few chuckles, but for rest of the cast Jaime Pressly, Brooke Burns, Maria Arcé, Sung Hi Lee and others they seemed painfully out of place. Granted they are very easy on the eyes, but fall far from comedy they are trying so hard to perform. Even the quasi evil Merle played by Diane Delano who you might remember as Officer Barbara Semanski from ""Northern Exposure"" failed to deliver a quality performance it was for the most part her reviving her role as Semanski. Overall the movie rambles and roams around never really grabbing your attention or tickling your funny bone. For all of it's effort to be funny it in the end falls to do so. Now for the record, I can handle a bad movie , I can handle really bad movies and I even enjoy them time to time, but somehow I doubt this movie will last long on my bad movie collection for it doesn't make it into the guilty pleasure or midnight movie class of films. Catch it on Comedy Central if you have to see it, it should be there real soon, but don't waste your money on it unless you can rent it for free.The DVD extras are thin and not very funny, the overall transfer and sound is good but not worth the $3.00 I paid for it.

I know what every single one of those ""what the heck is that?"" settings in router set up screens are.  So I do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many (most) who have had trouble with this router ""MORONS"".  Yes, I got it to work.  It will work right out of the box IF used with most pre-N wireless cards and, definitely, if they are Linksys pre-N cards.  That covers about 1% of those who would buy this router.  After three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default, I succeeded in getting it to ""hand-shake"" with b and g mode cards most of the time.  It would still randomly lose the IP requiring rebooting everything.  Not something my customer would accept nor would I sell.  Some of the techie specs are a long way from what Linksys claims. Linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both.  They failed.  A non-techie spec important to everyone is range.  It has 20% the range of an old b mode Linksys router I had sitting right next to it.  Adding encryption dropped range in half again!  The wired router portion of it works out of the box, no adjustments required.  But you're buying this for the wireless function.  Yes, I could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with.  But Linksys didn't used to be that way.  I used to buy only Linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware.  This is the third Linksys router in a month (the other two were g mode) that have been unstable or DOA.   Then why did I buy this one?  It was on sale and I wanted to give Linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good.  They've now lost it for good.  I exchanged the router for a Netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards.  Plus it was a lot less money.  Has Cisco ruined Linksys?  Got me.  Did all the good engineers cash out?  I wouldn't be surprised.  Are they rushing unfinished bug-filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for Wall Street?  You bet!

I know some people liked this third chapter, and they are entitled to their opinion. But I was utterly repulsed by this disgusting chapter. This 3rd chapter takes off just about where part 2 left off, and Jason claims another 2 victims. We then meet the next group of Jason's potential victims. This could have been a decent chapter except for what is to follow. With the possible exception of Kris and Shelly, this group of teenagers or young adults is so flat and 2d. There really is no getting to know them. Shelly and Kris go shopping and run into an obnoxious cycle gang. Shelly is a shy person who is unhappy with himself. He accidentally hits one of their cycles. When the gang leader breaks Shelly's windshield (or to be more accurate, the windshield of the car his friend loaned him), Shelly gets angry, chases the gang leader with the car and crushes his cycle. (The one and only redeeming element in this movie.) The cycle gang follows Shelly and want to burn down the barn to get even. They are so obnoxious and repulsive, we almost can't wait for Jason to kill them. And when he does, I doubt the average viewer will feel any sympathy for these 3 rotten people. Later, Kris tells about her past with Jason. (This was a little before Part 2.) Of course, Jason begins to kill the rest of the kids. Because they are so flat and 2d in this 3rd chapter, we don't really feel for them. Another annoying aspect of this film is that the murders are especially disgusting and vile in this 3rd chapter. (To be sure, I know this is suppose to be a horror, and that some people probably liked that aspect of it.) But even violence and murder can be filmed with a certain amount of taste. (In ""Saturday Night Fever"" Director John Badham did what he could to film a rape scene with at least some degree of taste! And let's be honest. In a way, rape is worse than murder.) As most of you know, Jason finds his hockey mask in this chapter. Well, following the typical formula, one person survives and manages to flip the tables on Jason. Since zero stars is not an option, I'll justify my 1 star rating the best I can. (The decent scene where Shelly runs over the cycle and the fact that Jason dispatches this obnoxious cycle gang warrant the one star.) I'll conclude by saying that if you don't have a problem with 2d flat characters and especially disgusting murders, then you probably will enjoy this 3rd chapter more than I did.

Recently, Entertainment Weekly compiled a list of the ""25 Worst Movie Sequels"" ever.  How ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" avoided its rightful place on this list is now one of the great mysteries of my life.  Like everyone else drawn to this unfortunate attempt at a film, I watched because I am a fan of John Landis' original ""American Werewolf.""  Watched, that is, 15 minutes...which was more than enough time to establish that this 'sequel' should have been stillborn during pre-production.  I was almost tempted to follow this 'film' to its conclusion, to see exactly how bad it could get, but I simply could not subject myself to such torture.  The only thing that could make this a worse movie?  Viewing the original ""Werewolf"" first, which will emphasize even more the tragedy that was ""American Werewolf in Paris.""So, why was this such a terrible movie?  I should have taken the DVD case description as a sign -- it explained that I would be watching a (I'm paraphrasing...but pretty close) 'rockin' horror film with a 'hip, up and coming group of young actors,' and, even better, I would be treated to 'a soundtrack complete with the hottest of today's music.'  Umm...no.  I challenge you to find more blatant lies than the ones offered by the movie's promoters.  To wit, a sample of several idiotic scenes and plot devices:(1) Tom Everett Scott wants to prove his courage by bungy jumping off the Eiffel Tower...which would be fine, except, given the shape of that particular structure (going out from top to bottom), our young hero would be jumping into the tower itself.  That might be a problem, but one he never seems to consider.  Can we really like a protagonist this stupid?  (2) Just before he is ready to leap, a young woman throws herself off the ledge.  T.E. Scott jumps to save her (despite the fact that his rope is not yet harnassed), and gracefully nabs her just before she becomes another splatter on the sidewalk.  She runs off, he (hey, I was right!) bangs his head on a beam and is put in hospital.  After waking, his concern for her is understandable...but why, in any rational universe, would he suddenly be infatuated with a clearly suicidal woman?  He says something to the effect that she is 'different' or 'sophisticated' or some other garbage...despite the fact that their relationship at that point comprises all of eight (wordless) seconds.  (Here, I'm also a bit nitpicky...because I can't for the life of me fathom why he would Julie Delpy even remotely attractive; mental instability is bad enough, but her looks hardly negate those problems).  Anyway, for absolutely no lucid reason, he suddenly decides that this is the girl of his dreams...the entire movie is based on his inexplicable admiration, a flaw symptomatic of the entire plot structure.  (3) The classic scene: the young lovers' first date...in which he 'accidentally' pulls out a handful of condoms, and to subdue her anxiety about his intentions, he is forced to pretend they are actually pieces of gum.  Yes, this is the level of sophistication clearly rampant throughout the movie.

198,Amazon,,"The ""Hardest Thing"" I've ever had to do Is listen to this cd, February 28, 2005Recently I had the misfortune to be given this cd by a homeless man. I was coming home from my job at the paper clip factory, where I put paper clips into cardboard boxes, when I passed a man asking for spare change. I apologized because I had none to give him, and he handed me this cd. ""Take this,"" he said in his grizzled wino voice. ""I tried to sell it to make money for food but no one would buy it.""So I brought the disc home and put it into my cd player while I was cooking dinner for myself and my seventeen dogs and also my latest mistress, Angela Adams. I wish I had not put it in the cd player, because the music that came out was really not that good.Imagine if the Backstreet Boys met O-Town for dinner, and the four least talented decided to step into the alleyway beside the restaurant for a few minutes and began to scat. N'Sync hears the racket and pops in to see if their services are needed, but Nick Lachey steps forward and says, ""No, N'Sync! Go away! We don't want any danceable beats or r&b flava in our music!"" So Justin Timberlake and crew slink back into the empty garage next door to practice their moonwalks.Not only is the 98 Degrees music boring, but an examination of the cd itself reveals more issues.1. The font which is used to write the words ""And Rising"" is an unfortunate choice. The components of the ""d"" in ""and"" are not joined as tightly as they might be, so the ""d"" looks like an ""al."" This changes the name of the album significantly.2. The boys are standing in front of a wall of fire, which I assume is supposed to be a reference to their name, 98 Degrees, which is a warm temperature. However, any idiot knows that fire is much hotter than 98 Degrees. Human beings are hotter than 98 Degrees, usually by about .6 degrees, and they BURN when put into fire. In fact, 98 Degrees the temperature is not that hot, just like 98 Degrees the performing group.3. Several of the members appear to have gotten tattoos of the band's name on their arms. How lame is that? Can you imagine if people in all bands did that?

195,Amazon,,"This would have to rank as one of the worst movies of all time. Overlong, boring, dreadful acting, embarrassing  screenplay. By the time you get to the battle sequence (meant to be the movie's centrepiece) you're so bored that you don't care what happens to any of the main characters. In fact, you end up hoping all the main characters die quickly so this pathetic movie will end. But I did find it very funny to listen to the dreadful dialogue, so at least I got some amusement from it.I actually found the battle scenes quite disrespectful to the memory of the men and women who died at Pearl Harbor. Scenes of people dying horribly using modern-cinema realism and gore was quite repulsive and offensive. I'm surprise Michael Bay was allowed to get away with it. As I watched the gore-fest that is the battle, I wondered what those people who died that day would think of the way their deaths were portrayed - like some ghoulish freakshow for us 60 years later to watch and say with a morbid smile on our face ... Oooooo ... ahhh ... yuck. It would have been much better if Bay had gone down the tasteful, respectful path rather than the shock, showman route.My favourite cringe-worthy lines -Alec Baldwin as the General (or whatever he was) - The heart of a volunteer is the noblest of all.Josh Hartnett, while looking at himself in the mirror wearing his uniform - (Crying) You know, whenever I see mahself in this here uniform .... I just don't feel like a hero. (Cries some more).Also cringe-worthy is the way the Japanese are portrayed in the movie. Whenever we see Americans, there is beautiful music playing behind images of pretty scenery and lovely, bright colours. Whenever the Japanese are shown, we see dark, grey tones and booming, dark, evil music thumping away. Cut back to Americans ... cue pretty music and bright colours. Talk about manipulate the audience's emotions, rather than Bay making his point in some subtle way ... like a good script.How can anyone think this piece of garbage is worth 4 stars?The soundtrack is incredible though. Hans Zimmer's score is truly wonderous. Its a pity his talent and genius was wasted on such trash",long,2159,379,neutral,good,good,"I 'm surprise Michael Bay was allowed to get away with it .<q>Overlong , boring , dreadful acting , embarrassing screenplay .<q>( Cries some more ) .Also cringe-worthy is the way the Japanese are portrayed in the movie .","In fact , you end up hoping all the main characters die quickly so this pathetic movie will end .

196,Amazon,,"I was really looking forward to this game, and I was prepared to overlook one or two things.  Every game has it's own personality, right?  I found instead this game actually doesn't have much of one at all.  I didn't mind the graphics.  Not cutting edge sure, but not that bad either.  A little muddy but a change from cartoony.  It was hard to enjoy closeup views, however, when so many buildings lost their roof on zoom.  No way to toggle that feature.  The camera angles were frustrating and it was very difficult to pick anything out with the mouse accurately.  Not that there was much time to look at the scenery.  Immigrants came.  And came.  And came.  Whether there were houses and jobs available or not.  As long as city happiness was high enough, which meant that everyone was happy.  Which they were not.  Because they had no houses or jobs.  To keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy.  Forget planning.  Forget balancing resources with workshops and markets.  It wasn't clear what the balance was in any case.  It would take trial and error, and you didn't have the time.  For you were building worshops like mad, trying to guess at how many citizens would be employed by each, and researching for temporary bumps to keep your city from being deserted in droves.  The best income boosts were not through sale of goods or trade.  It was through research, maximising the tax base with the development of currency and so on.  You hit those early on, and reached a certain population level, you made money.  The rest of the time you spent trying to keep people from leaving.  There was no stability in reaching any level.  It quickly became a game of keep up.  There was no way to control immigration or set the pace of development.  And for all the decorative options, more than the similar games out, you really didn't care in the end what your city looked like, because it just cost time.  Money too, but that was really not the relevant issue.  Unless people were unhappy.  Then you could stick a few things, quickly, somewhere.  You just can't enjoy a leisurely pace of planning, building and finishing it off with a nudge here and there and watching it run...you have to be constantly involved in the process, staying ahead of the curve.  You don't have to worry about maintenance, such as city fires or engineers, but the cities cannot not be made self-sufficient or self-sustaining with this inherent instability built into the gameplay.  Five or ten minutes away from the screen will bring most cities, if not all, to a screeching halt.While I enjoyed the research options, and the ability to move homes I thought was a great innovation, not having the ability to control the flow of immigrants to the city and pegging success to city happiness makes this game a poor economic simulation and the gameplay ultimately very shallow and unsatisfying.",long,2900,505,neutral,neutral,good,"To keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy .<q>Because they had no houses or jobs .<q>Every game has it 's own personality , right ?","To keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy .

163,Amazon,,"The Grudge series is one that has been ongoing for quite some time now, beginning with an extremely low-budget and nearly plotless television miniseries known as ""Ju-On: The Curse"".  It was a bizarre and creepy little concoction that was quite good and served as a protype or test run for what I consider to be the scariest ghost story ever told ""Ju-On: The Grudge"".  That film ws mercilessly creepy and had me looking over my shoulder at the darkness surrounding me even as I watched it.  It got under my skin like no film had in years and I loved it.  The American remake was a promising idea, with the same director reprising his role, but it was awful.  My wife, sister, and I literally laughed through the climax in the theater and ridiculed the film mercilessly all the way home.  But when I saw a Japanese sequel was being released, I perked up, remembering the brilliance of the first film.  Dear God, do I hate this movie.  First and foremost, there is nothing scary about a haunted wig.  I know that japanese filmmakers seem to think nothing in the world is as terrifying as cartoonishly long black hair, but I'm sure even they should know that the terror doesn't transfer to self-mobile wigs.  And then there's the haunted bootyprint.  You read that right, a wet bootyprint that is haunted.  The notion that a filmmaker thought these device would be good is much scarier than the application of these devices ever could be.  And then there's that horrible sequence where a soccer ball turns into little ghostboy Toshio's head and frightens a girl to literal death.  The unintentionsl laughs keep on coming.  Picture this:  a woman is in a hospital, legs locked in stirups giving birth.  You with me?  The woman is pushing and the baby is on the way and suddenly the lights go out and the doctors hear the horrible strangled croak that means mama ghost is here.  Can you guess where it is she emerges from? In horror films there is good disgusting and bad disgusting;  there is nothing at all good about watching a fully grown corpse climb out of a woman's.....area.  These scenes alone could kill any movie, but the bad keeps on coming.  The overly convoluted out-of-sequence storytelling tries so hard to be as cool as ""Pulp Fiction"" and other such films but only succeeds if the goal was giving me a headache and proving that this is a storytelling device that should only be used by trained professionals.  I watched the film again, hoping to sort out the details of what the hell I had just watched, hoping that there was a good film in there somewhere that I missed the first time and only got angrier that I had now wasted twice as much time on this hate-crime of a sequel to a horror classic. I cannot believe that the same man made both films.  At this point, I'm throwing in the towel on what was once an extremely promising horror franchise.  This hackjob may well be the deathnail in the already stagnating Asian horror genre; I think J-horror is on it's last legs and fright fans will have to start searching for fresh ideas elsewhere.

I bought it because I bought a small pate terrine, and I was looking for something to grind small amounts of chicken livers, pork and so on. I was dubious -- it seemed to kind of cheesy. But I thought that as long as it basically worked, it was fine.I put in some chicken breasts for a pate recipe, and those were fine. But the, I put in some pork. It squished up in the machine and couldn't come out. It got stuck and I had to remove the mincing plate. I tried the larger plate. The same thing happened. Essentially, any meat with even a small amount of fat can't be ground in this machine. It has only a small, not very sharp grinder blade element. Given that the meat you'd tend to grind would be for the likes of sausages, pates and for hamburger, it makes this machine useless. I actually had some hamburger in my fridge. Just for fun, I tried putting that through the machine. It also didn't work on that -- and it was ALREADY ground!!I thought, OK, I'll try it for some pasta. Maybe that will redeem it enough to keep it. No way. The engineering on a playdoh machine is better. The dough comes out and immediately tangles with whatever comes out of it. It also just gets stuck and refuses to move through the machine. There's no way to make any kind of ""strands"" of pasta. I tried three separate pasta recipes. I am a culinary school graduate, and a professional cook -- i know how to make pasta. This machine just doesn't work. Then, I went to clean it up. It took 40 minutes, using a skewer and Q-tips to get the pasta out of the little holes. The suction cup device that is supposed to hold it onto a counter works only temporarily. It seems sturdy, but then you start to crank and it comes right off. The sausage funnel is way too small to actually use for sausage.It sort of works for nuts, but then, I can use a coffee grinder for that. Take my advice -- get the right machine for the job. Get a cast iron meat grinder; they sell them on Amazon. Get a separate pasta machine, the stainless steel kind that breaks the pasta down into sheets of thickness.

However, the frustration and anger I experienced with this thing remind me of the importance of helping others to avoid similar situations. So if you are looking for a hi-tech media player this IS NOT it, but if you are looking for a device to help raise your blood pressure, the DSM-520 will do an excellent job. I also wasted most of the weekend with this crummy device...1. Online support and FAQs are horribly inadequate. Phone tech support was comedically tragic. I was forwarded incorrectly, asked for all manner of personal info that was not relevant to the issue, experienced dropped calls, long waits and finally spoke with an unintelligible foreign person who simply did not understand what I was trying to do or what the problems were.2. The performance of the devise is apalling. The device has several different input/output options. I suggest using a standard TV with basic component RCA inputs for basic setup to simplify your life. I spent alot of time moving/connecting the DSM-520 between locations and TVs because the in/outs need to be specified using the onscreen menu (the remote has buttons for this but most users would be unaware as I was). In many instances it may not display on your TV when you first turn it on (a source of enormous confusion). Secondly, if you utilize a secure wireless LAN I would suggest connecting through the wired Ethernet port first, to ensure your LAN settings are not preventing it from working (another source of frustration). In my case, the DSM-520 would not connect to my LAN using the automated setup via Windows Connect Now. After finally resetting my router I finally resolved the network connection between my LAN and the DSM-520. 3. I have an Iomega StorCenter external network attached storage (NAS) device that I wanted to utilize as the media server. It has built-in server capabilities. Tech support was baffled by this. All I wanted to know was whether I could use this device to serve media to the DSM-520 with my computer powered off. I know I'm not the only person on the planet trying to do this when BOTH packages state very clearly on the front that they can stream digital media to/from a PC or network attached storage device using a univeral plug and play digital media adapeter (UPnP DMA). Both devices are UPnP!! Anyway, tech support was useless, as was the user guide and online documentation and support.4. Lastly, once I got the thing running I was sorely disappointed with the overall performance. The DSM-520 couldn't index my files properly so I kept getting strange results onscreen. Eventually, after locating music files, I was disappointed to find out that it would display only about 5 at a time on the TV. I could scroll down about 10-15 songs before it would need to take 3 seconds lag to refresh another 10-15 songs. Since I have over 4,000 songs, this process would be painstakingly tedious anytime I wanted to locate a specific song. I briefly checked the photo and video functions and like another person stated, it took 2-3 seconds for each photo to change. You must be joking?! The overall impression was that this thing is sluggish. Pressing the remote and waiting for the device to respond is enraging in most instances. In the end, I'm taking it back. More importantly, D-Link did not impress me with their customer service, user guide or online documentation.

This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course.The Federal agent meets to report to her higher ups. Then we see terrorists prepare to hold up a bank to raise money for their activities (based on real events). Most bank robberies are done by ordinary criminals who are not part of any group. (The FBI put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s.) This Federal agency doesn't interfere because they want more information on their aims (and their leaders). More terrorism is planned: dynamiting a courthouse, attacking a power station, etc. The terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day! Kathy finds a secret list of ""friends"". This is quickly copied with a camera. The Federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them. Gary meets with the leader (who arrives in a helicopter!) And shows documents that say Kathy is a special investigator. Is Kathy being served up as a sacrifice? Gary and Kathy travel to Chicago, where an assassination is planned that will make Gary the fall guy. (Another Lee Harvey Oswald?)

A few years later his film about rebels in South America was popular. His later films have seemed mediocre. A better story might not have tried to cover so many details and plots as this film does; better pacing could help. The threat from domestic terrorism still needs a good film (e.g., Timothy McVeigh). Those who gave this film a high rating must love the images more than the facts.A better film today would show the bad results from ""NAFTA"" and ""Free Trade"" in harming most Americans economically. But Hollywood would never allow a film about this ""war on the middle class"". The word `nafta' in Greek and Arabic refers to `petroleum'. NAFTA is a symbol for the policies designed for Big Oil.

First of all, in Word, the view markups function is the default now, so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups (most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way). However, if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version of Word the recipient has, and you can't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again, view markups, reject the comments, Accept Changes, and resave.

Even when using Word 2002, the changes were still in the documents, and anyone could see them just by turning on the display. All that has happened in 2003 is that the display is automatic.

184,Amazon,,"What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time, The Re-Animator.  Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite.  Beyond Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story.As with Dagon, Yuzna seems to have secured financing from Spanish sources for this film.  Unfortunately, the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly Spanish cast.  This is a story set in Massachusetts, for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison, the reporter coming to cover the story, the guards, and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have Spanish accents?  It wouldn't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act, but they can't.  Simon Andreu as Warden Brando and Elsa Pataky as love interest Laura Olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast, but their acting is so bad, and their ADR-afflicted lines so glaringly off, that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths.  Yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes (witness the gratuitous ""nurse nipple"" scene in this film, or Fabiana Udenio and Kathleen Kinmont in Bride of Re-Animator), and Pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests I can remember.But even Pataky and Andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery, seething mass of bad acting that is leading man Jason Barry.  Based on Yuzna's shoddy history with actors, one might be tempted to blame it on the director, but the fact is that in this film, Jason Barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment, basic elementary acting.  His every internal and external beat rings false, his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading, and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre.  Most high-school students do better than this.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, seasoned pro that he is, gamely plays along, but the script puts West's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing Pataky-Andreu axis that Combs is unable to save this film.On a strictly technical level, the cinematography looks good, the score is all right (though often too serious-minded for its own good), and the film doesn't look low-budget.  But when the ""story"" is such a mess and the actors so inept, no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film.  Yuzna really should stick with producing, because on the Stuart Gordon-directed Dagon, at least there were some good moments.

162,Amazon,,"It's a truism that great novels make lousy movies. For evidence of that fact, you need look no further.As the great Hollywood novel (at least there's no convincing competitor), it was inevitable that ""Day of the Locust"" would hit the screen eventually. And when the time came, some effort was made to ensure the job was done right, beginning with the selection of the director, John Schlesinger, a literate British expatriate with a superb track record. But the 70s was the epoch of good intentions gone awry, in film as in everything else.""Locust"" was made during the period when many people considered William Atherton to be an actor. You can see him in a number of major films, his expression never changing, with all the emotional impact of a log. It's one of those things that lends conviction to the claim that the industry runs on herd instinct.But it's not all Atherton's fault, because nobody comes to life in this flick. Not even Karen Black, one of the most idiosyncratic actresses ever, for all that she's playing a hooker (Karen must have gotten very tired of that kind of role). Not even old pro Burgess Meredith, as her deadbeat old man. Donald Sutherland reveals a flicker or two, for all that he's supposed to be playing a lump. The sole exception is Jackie Earle Haley, who portrays the evil-minded child actor Adore with truly demonic intensity. Maybe they should have let him direct.It would seem difficult to make scenes like the collapse of a huge Napoleonic war set or an illegal cockfight look dull, but Sclesinger brings it off. I don't know how -- this is, after all, the guy who made the selection of a new wardrobe for Cold War traitor Guy Burgess look enlightening and entertaining in ""An Englishman Abroad"". Maybe the milieu overwhelmed him. It's happened to other people.It all comes to a head at the climax, which is supposed to illuminate an apocalyptic painting of the destruction of LA by Atherton's Todd. In a single truly effective scene, the distraught Homer Simpson murders the noxious child actor Adore. And then...Well, if you want to see the dullest riot scene in film history, here you are. It's as if Schlesinger said, ""Okay, this the 30s, and there were Nazis around during the 30s -- so let's make the rioters Nazis!"" Thus we get a lengthy sequence in which people wearing very silly masks (they look like a chorus of Leatherfaces from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") stand in one spot goose-stepping. Every now and then the camera shifts to a masked woman staring through a car windshield. And that's your riot. To top things off, Schlesinger then gives us a ""symbolic"" coda that succeeds only in casting into doubt everything we've seen for the past two hours. Nathanael West had an unbelievably tough career as an author. His publisher went bankrupt a week before ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" was due to be published. He died in a car crash only a short time after ""Locust"" appeared. Then they went and made this movie.

156,Amazon,,"Before the retard Peter Dolving returned to the Haunted, they had released their peak album ""One Kill Wonder"" which was flawless from start to finish. Nothing but sheer brutality, rhythmic technicality, and breakneck thrash going at 1000 MPH. This is the only thing that anyone who was once in At the Gates has ever done that was even close to achieving the greatness of the aforementioned band. Their second record was pretty damn good as well. Then, unfortunately, the frontman for this era of the Haunted (Marco Aro) left shortly after some shows for the OKW album and their original vocalist returned to the fold. While his style of vocals worked for their 1998 debut, he was still the weak link in the band. But, with them having been on the roll that they were on, I never would have imagined that it could have hindered them. Boy, was I wrong. In late 2004, they released the rEVOLVEr album and proved to be a shocking disappointment. They added in these boring, dragging, hicked out slow songs with some horrible and just dumb sounding vocal displays and all the thrashing that remained were lazy riffs with more bad vocals. The production was weak as could be, and all the anger and feeling was gone. The only tracks with any staying power were the two bonus tracks on the limited edition and even those had some annoying vocal parts. Peter Dolving just is not a good vocalist. He wants to be the next Phil Anselmo and it's so obvious. From his drug addict stories to some of his hicked out clean singing to his attitude on stage. Due to the fact that he was 75% of the reason why the band had been brought down so drastically, I didn't really have any interest when I heard that the Haunted had been recording for a new album. With Dolving at the helm, there really isn't anywhere left for them to go. A source obtained the album before it's release so I decided what the hell? Might as well give it a listen....It's like they thought of all the worst things they could possibly do, and went ahead and did them. First off, making all the songs start with ""THE"" has been done before and if it's not for a reason, it's quite stupid. Not only are the Haunted no longer a thrash band, but one can almost go as far as to say that the Haunted are no longer a METAL band. All the most terrible ideas on rEVOLVEr are the ones constantly exercised on this one. The whole thing practically is Dolving's clean singing accompanied by slow, boring, redneckish riffs. There is no technicality, no speed, no aggression, NOTHING. I cannot believe that this is what is left of At the Gates. (Not that Adrian Erlandsson is doing any better) It's so much worse than I could have even imagined. There is not one song that I didn't just want to hit the skip button so bad while hearing it. And that weak production from their last album remains as well.If you enjoyed the real Haunted, stay away from their last release, and stay even farther away from this one. The Haunted are done. I'll just stick to the 2nd and 3rd records. After seeing what that moron has done to this band, I can't even enjoy the first album.

All three of these songs, in fact, are on Death on the Road.  You'd think I'd be happy, but, I'm afraid, I am not.In 2001, Iron Maiden released a live album entitled Rock in Rio.  Long story short: Buy it.  Don't buy this.  They are basically the same thing, except Rock in Rio lacks songs from Dance of Death, and the mediocre (and that's being nice) performance that accompanies them on Death on the Road.What happened?  I was so anxious for this album I imported it from Japan to avoid waiting for the delayed USA release.  When I first popped this in my CD player, I thought I was experiencing a hearing malfunction, but, unfortunately for Iron Maiden - I wasn't.  What I was experiencing, however, was a band going through the motions.  Track by track you will find a vocalist struggling to reach the notes he achieves in the studio, you will find Janick unable to replicate his solos, you will find tempos slowed or tempos rushed to the point of annoyance.   You will find one of the most ho-hum live performances from one of metal's greatest bands.  You will find yourself - fist clenched - screaming to the heavens ""Why God?  WHY!?""A live album is supposed to make you either remember, or wish you were at the concert.  It's also helpful if the performance is at least close, or equal to the one a band delivers in studio.  Live albums have long been hit or miss for Iron Maiden (hit: Live After Death, miss: A Real Live/Dead One) - and this, I'm afraid, is a miss.  The only thing you'll ""miss"" by avoiding this release is Bruce gasping for air on most of the songs.  You might also miss the one millionth performance of ""Run to the Hills"" - could you live with that on your conscience?  I hope you can, because your wallet will thank you.  Need a Maiden live fix?  Get Rock in Rio.  Absolutely need to have every Maiden release?

175,Amazon,,"Considering the director's track-record, the high quality of the original movie (The Poseidon Adventure) and the budget available for making this remake, I found Poseidon to be an absolutely awful and uninteresting movie and a complete waste of time and money. I give it 1 star because I cannot go any lower than that. I read the reviews before watching it, so I was prepared for the worst, but it was even worse than I expected. Let's keep in mind we're talking about a film that is supposed to be a blockbuster movie here, not a mere TV-film. The only positive thing I have to say about it, is that it is mercifully short. While watching it on DVD, I barely overcame the urge to fast-forward certain scenes. The plot has holes so big an oceanliner the size of Titanic could sail through them and still have room to maneuver. There is no introduction, no explanation whatsoever as to where the ship is going, who the people are, what caused the monster-wave, etc. Calling the main characters two- instead of three-dimensional is giving them too much credit. You don't care at all whether they survive or die, the only exception perhaps being the little boy. The CGI effects aren't all that great either. I never knew so much things could explode on a partially submerged ocean-liner (a typical and, to me, illogical and extremely irritating Hollywood trademark). The movie really is no more than a boring and repetitious series of clims and crawls through poorly lit and generally burning areas. The water is supposed to be cold and salt, but that doesn't show, even for a second. Although they are just (first-time) passengers, the people involved know their way around the vessel remarkably well (even though it is turned upside down)and have an uncanny knowledge about its inner workings and where to go for escape. They know exactly which hatch or stairwell to take and which button to push, even scared and exhausted in the dark and underwater. Ever been inside a large ship or ferry boat yourself ? You don't know which end is which or where to go if your life depends on it. At the end of the movie, the survivors reach daylight and: lo and behold: there's just one piece of wreckage afloat and it is an inflated life-raft, conveniently located near the bow-thrusters. In typical Hollywood tradition, the ship sinks bare seconds after the survivors have climbed inside the raft. Mr Petersen's Poseidon project should have sunk well before he got started.

189,Amazon,,"It's a cliche to say any particular movie is the worst ever made.  I'm sure worse films have actually been produced.  I just cant think of them right now even after sitting here and trying for about 5 minutes.  To put it in perspective, the recent made for Sci Fi Channel movie ""Mansquito"" was a masterpiece compared to Dungeons and Dragons the movie.  Apparently some crackpot nobody guy wrote the screenplay and even directed this travesty of a film and was as much a genius at self-salesmanship as he an utter incompetent at filmcraft.  The blunders inherent here range from the systemic to the minutely technical.  In this one sense, at least, the film is consistent.  The casting is awful, the acting atrocious, the writing is phenomenally bad.  The sets and costumes rest uneasily in that wretched zone between camp and simply inept.  And then there is the plot.  Of course, the scale of the drama is truly grand, the writers were not afraid to embrace the tired cliche of every bad fantasy novel, of the unlikely band of heroes tasked to save the Universe and face the ULTIMATE MENACE.  Yet the plot frequently stumbles down even this well worn path, as each scene seems more jarringly unlikely and hackneyed than the one before it, to the point that one quickly loses any sense that there is a plot at all. By contrast, even basic Dungeon-crawls can actually make for pretty interesting and dramatic stories.  In fact, I think this is where a lot of D&D fans were really let down.  Even if only due to the random element introduced by the dice, the twists and turns of a reasonably good rpg session can be far more nuanced and interesting than your typical fantasy movie or TV series.  I think most people who have played an RPG at one time or another have thought of this, perhaps leading to the greatest hope that was dashed by this incredibly bad film: a real D&D game could probably have been the basis for quite a good plot.  But this movie bore little if any resemblance to even the most hackneyed D&D game ever played by anybody over the age of puberty, and rather than advancing the fantasy genre forward, it definately took it several steps back.On a more technical level, the completely ridiculous props and costumes which would have raised eyebrows in an Ed Wood film don't help much in the suspension of disbelief department, and the very clunky CGI rounded out the general feeling of complete disconnect.Even if you are the sort of person who likes almost any kind of science fiction or fantasy fare, avoid this, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  This is quite simply one of those films you just can't go along with no matter how much you might want to.  It's worse than the Postman, or Waterworld, or the worst Xena episode you ever saw.  I'm only giving it one star because I can't give it zero or negative stars.  I would actually for the record prefer to give this negative 5 stars.This is another classic blunder of marketing by WOTC, which goes back to earlier PR efforts in the history of the game and it's previous owners (TSR).  Once again they managed to make their fairly interesting game look completely stupid, following in a noble tradition including a really bad cartoon series or two and going all the way back to the botched 60 minutes interview where the reasonably benign Gary Gygax somehow came across like Charlie Manson.  I'm certain they could not have done a worse job of marketing this game to the mainstream if that was their original plan.

On August 11, Kensington told me that they do not know when the password registration process will be working, and they strongly urged me to send the product back for a refund.  On July 27 I wrote:This should be a great item at a great price.  And as far as I can tell, it works fine.  Kensington has some serious technical problems, however.   The encryption installs and becomes fully-functional before you can register your USB key and password.  Registration is essential in case you lose the key or forget your password.  This is a BIG problem, because as of July 26, 2006,  Kensington's registration utility was down and not expected to be working until 6-10 days(current estimate).  Worse, the message I got when attempting to register my key the first two days was ""Authentication Failed"" which told me nothing.  Even worse, their overseas technical support person did not know about the problem. So he also thought I had a defective key, and we wasted a lot of time discussing replacement and timing (I'm about to leave on a trip and really wanted this protection for the trip).  When I finally realized that I would not receive a new key before I left, I asked whether I should uninstall the product or whether I could register the key verbally in case the key was lost on the trip (I figured the answer was no but I was getting desperate).  He went away for a long time, then he reported that he would have to call me back (that took 40 minutes) and finally he reported that probably my key was fine, it's the registration that was offline.  And no, there is no other way to register - that's part of the security.So the encryption is in place, the laptop boots and runs fine, but I have two days to decide whether to risk taking my laptop and losing the physical key, which means I would have to wipe my hard drive, or risk uninstalling the encryption and having the laptop stolen, in which case I still lose all my data AND sensitive data is exposed.

Ok...that one was on the house.The most painful of the two was FALLEN HEROES. What was originally released in two parts, was re released at the beginning of Season 7 in a two hour movie which included some really awesome footage put back in. Including a scene introducing Gharty's wife and which also included more violence which added to the horror of the what was happening.But what were we given for $99 bucks, (at Best Buy) the best of the series SPLIT in two without the inclusion of those scenes.I mean in each box set, which aren't that cheap mind you, we're treated to a boring behind the scenes and some thrown together commentary...which doesn't even include cast members.I think season 5 had Clark Johnson but he was commenting more from a directors stand point.And finally a dumb thrown together ""MUSIC from the show"" menu. Which anyone who is a fan or admirer of the show has already gotten from someones else's WEBSITE while the show was still on the AIR!Oh and NO DELETED SCENES? My ass.I mean we're not even treated to a GREAT PICTURE let alone a truly surround sound experience. I mean...was that too much to ask? Were the other cast members too busy right now to join up for 45 minutes to talk about the show?I mean where is all that footage from the Homicide conventions that happened?I mean this is one of the greatest if not the GREATEST police shows ever to be produced and yet they don't care enough to produce a great DVD.Oh but CHARLES IN CHARGE SEASON 1 gets the works.I mean compared to THE SHIELD, Homicide looks like blues clues, but is still amazing to watch and to see how the show progressed, even then was ahead of it's time. Homicide was one of the first to include music as a drive for scenes which many have copied newer example being COLD CASE.So now here we are with Season 7 DVD box set.Of course I will waste my hard earned dough for the set, only because this is the only way to get them. But is it really worth the price tag? NO.Better luck finding complete episodes on VHS and copy your own to DVD.And you can truly say you've put more time and energy into it than A&E or NBC has.Sorry for those of you who find this negative, but after Season 6 being cut short, never to have those full length shows again...I feel cheated and used.I mean I even had to make my own SOUNDTRACK because there never was one released.Oh but if you want, rush out and pick of the JOAN OF ARCADIA soundtrack...gimme a break.Hope this was helpful.B",long,3232,593,good,neutral,neutral,"What was originally released in two parts , was re released at the beginning of Season 7 in a two hour movie which included some really awesome footage put back in .<q>Including a scene introducing Gharty 's wife and which also included more violence which added to the horror of the what was happening.But what were we given for $ 99 bucks , ( at Best Buy ) the best of the series SPLIT in two without the inclusion of those scenes.I mean in each box set , which are n't that cheap mind you , we 're treated to a boring behind the scenes and some thrown together commentary ... which does n't even include cast members.I think season 5 had Clark Johnson but he was commenting more from a directors stand point.And finally a dumb thrown together `` MUSIC from the show '' menu .<q>Which anyone who is a fan or admirer of the show has already gotten from someones else 's WEBSITE while the show was still on the AIR !

3,Amazon,,"This book would be an excellent addition to the library of anyone interested in the evolution of Western thought, and especially those wanting more light on the role of Hermeticism and two of its most significant offspring, Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry.The Golden Builders leaps into the same league as the works of such respected esoteric scholars as Francis Yates and Antoine Favre, though in many ways it is more satisfying. It is quite readable, direct, and delightfully uncluttered with obscure references, vague associations, and specious conclusions. In most cases, Churton is very clear with his suppositions and conservative with his speculations, and he provides thorough footnotes. Unlike many authors who have attempted to accomplish similar aims, Churton carefully elucidates the many personal relationships and connections among his central characters, as well as analysing their personalities and motivations. This accomplishment is clearly the result of Churton's painstaking examination of many period publications, personal writings, and private communications. The Golden Builders skillfully reveals the extent to which the original Rosicrucian documents and the ensuing furor of interest fits so perfectly into the religious and political climate of the Renaissance and Reformation. Johann Valentin Andreae receives much deserved attention as a literary genius with significant connections among other influential men of the time. On a broader scale, the Rosicrucian myth and movement is placed squarely within the evolution of Hermeticism as a transformative element in Western thought. Readers interested in the history and formation of Freemasonry might also be pleased to find that Churton carefully explores the intellectual atmosphere and cultural conditions surrounding the two earliest known Accepted Masons, Robert Moray and Elias Ashmole, especially the latter.

4,Amazon,,"Giles Slade opens this monograph with a flurry of astounding facts: in 2004, 315 million working PCs were thrown out in North America alone, and in the following year over 100 million cell phones joined them on the trashheap. That's tons of electronic equipment-larded with non-biogradable components and toxic waste-filling up garbage dumps around the world.What drives this rush to trash? According to Slade, it obsolescence, rather than failure. Your last computer likely didn't wear out-you junked it because a faster, lighter, and spiffier one came out.Since the Great Depression, it's been clear that consumption, rather than production, drives the economy. With America getting more efficient at producing goods, it follows that, to precent another economic downturn, someone has to convince people to buy more goods.Slade traces the roots of ""repetitive consumption back to the beginnings of branding and packaging in the middle of the 19th century. Over time, the American ethic of thrift collapsed before social pressures to buy new, rather than save the old. The first several chapters nicely sketch the cultural changes-and their underlying economic drivers-that created the annual model change. Similarly, producers began obliquely discussing ""planned obsolescene."" This could mean, in the case of automobiles, that the customer would decide on his own to buy a more up-to-date car in the latest model, or, in some cases, that internal components unable to be replaced would fail after a set lifespan. ""Death dating"" products was a controversial practice, but many in various industries (particularly consumer electronics) supported it.The author is at his best when he is talking about the pivotal players-such as GM's Alfred Sloan and RCA's David Sarnoff-and the modern development of planned obsolescence. He also deftly handles the transition from mechanical obsolescence to psychological obsolescence-the thing that makes some people buy a new car every two years, despite the fact that their old one still works fine. Advertising and marketing efforts convinced the public that, in almost every case, newer was better. Slade uncovers just how our disposable goods, from razors to Razrs, came to be.The book veers slightly in a chapter on ""Weaponizing Obsolescence,"" which details a compex scheme under which American counter-espionage agents allowed the Soviets to ""steal"" plans for technology that was designed to fail. While it's a compelling story-you can easily see that this is a screenplay in the making-it takes the book a little off course, and might have been better as a standlone article or book in its own right. Also, there might have been more discussion of another force driving disposable electronics: rising wages and lower costs of finished goods. The parts needed to repair your broken DVD player are probably not expensive, but buying an hour of a trained mechanic's time to repair it is likely more than the original cost. Therefore, it makes more sense to throw it out and buy anew than to get it fixed. Surely, that's got just as much to do with the rise of disposabiltiy as clever marketing.All in all, this is a good book that raises many troubling questions, particuarly this one: what are we going to do with all of our ""obsolete"" trash? I recommend it for anyone who's interested in the history of technology, the economy, or consumer electronics",long,3393,541,good,good,suboptimal,"Giles Slade opens this monograph with a flurry of astounding facts : in 2004 , 315 million working PCs were thrown out in North America alone , and in the following year over 100 million cell phones joined them on the trashheap .<q>With America getting more efficient at producing goods , it follows that , to precent another economic downturn , someone has to convince people to buy more goods.Slade traces the roots of `` repetitive consumption back to the beginnings of branding and packaging in the middle of the 19th century .<q>Slade uncovers just how our disposable goods , from razors to Razrs , came to be.The book veers slightly in a chapter on `` Weaponizing Obsolescence , '' which details a compex scheme under which American counter-espionage agents allowed the Soviets to `` steal '' plans for technology that was designed to fail .","Giles Slade opens this monograph with a flurry of astounding facts : in 2004 , 315 million working PCs were thrown out in North America alone , and in the following year over 100 million cell phones joined them on the trashheap .

5,Amazon,,"Charlemagne's reign was a brief flash of light in the dark centuries that followed the collapse of the Roman empire. As king of the Franks, Charlemagne unified much of Western Europe - what today is northeastern Spain, all of France, and parts of Germany and Italy. He revived education and learning, repaired existing churches and built new ones, and helped strengthen the position of the Pope in Rome. In the year 800 Charlemagne was crowned Emperor Augustus, ruler of the new Roman empire. This new empire was short lived, but Charlemagne became legend. Einhard, a scholar in Charlemagne's court and author of this short biography, was faced with a difficult question: how does one write a balanced and honest biography of a revered king, a king that had become legendary in his own time?Einhard had few examples to follow. The religious biographies of saints were not entirely appropriate. He turned to a classical source, The Lives of the Caesars by the Roman historian Seutonius. Einhard devotes about half of his work to Charlemagne's extensive military campaigns, but his focus remains on Charlemagne the leader and Charlemagne the man, not on military tactics and strategy.The modern reader will find it helpful to read between the lines. Einhard obviously admired Charlemagne, and his criticisms are muted. Also, Einhard's writing reflects a world view very different from today. For example, Einhard in discussing the continual uprising of the Saxons says: he never allowed their faithless behavior to go unpunished, but either took the field against them in person, or sent his counts with an army to wreak vengeance and exact righteous satisfaction. Wreak vengeance? Exact righteous satisfaction? The editor's footnote explains that at the time of a revolt in 782 Charlemagne had 4,500 Saxons beheaded in one day at Verden. Similarly, after a formidable conspiracy in Germany was put down, ""all the traitors were banished, some of them without mutilation, others after their eyes had been put out"".Einhard provides many details of Charlemagne's character and private life. Charlemagne enjoyed the exhalations from natural hot springs. He often practiced swimming; few could surpass him in this sport. Einhard carefully describes the clothing worn by Charlemagne. He apparently disliked  foreign costumes, and was most comfortable in the common dress of the Frankish people. He was temperate in eating, and especially drinking. He was particularly fond of roast meat prepared on a spit and disregarded medical advice to eat only boiled meat. He could speak Latin fluently.  St. Augustine's The City of God was among his favorite books. He never developed proficiency at writing, although he practiced regularly during his later years. Einhard's biography was immensely popular and more than eighty manuscripts still exist today.My copy of The Life of Charlemagne was published by Ann Arbor Paperbacks, University of Michigan Press. The foreword by historian Sidney Painter was quite helpful in establishing the historical context. My copy includes a ninth century map of Europe, footnotes, and a genealogical table for the family of Charlemagne and Hildegard",long,3170,500,neutral,neutral,neutral,"In the year 800 Charlemagne was crowned Emperor Augustus , ruler of the new Roman empire .<q>As king of the Franks , Charlemagne unified much of Western Europe - what today is northeastern Spain , all of France , and parts of Germany and Italy .<q>Also , Einhard 's writing reflects a world view very different from today .","As king of the Franks , Charlemagne unified much of Western Europe - what today is northeastern Spain , all of France , and parts of Germany and Italy .

7,Amazon,,"First of all, I have eagerly awaited this book since its release in July.  I was NOT disappointed.  I have listened to the author many times on Coast to Coast AM and he is the only guest that can keep my attention for the full three to four hour span of the interview.  Several times, I have been very groggy the next morning at work, but this was a small price to pay for the entertaiment. value. The book is written in a warm conversational style that is very compelling.  The stories are fascinating and I can assure you that once started you will not be able to put the book down until you have completed it.  The ""decades long run of bad luck"" for many of the bands makes us realise that nothing just happens on its own.  I especially enjoyed the sections on the Buddy Holly Curse and ""The Club"".  It is amazing the number of peformers who died in their twenty-seventh year.After reading some of the reviews given here, I thought that I may have a reading comprehension problem.  This work is not a listing of rock and roll obituaries (thank God) and I found no evidence of moralising on the role of backward tracks.  I found a very objective look at backward masking that included a great deal of humor by the author.  I remember the early 1980s when religion clashed with the rock industry.  Those accounts are given objectively in the work and I suppose some individuals have formed an opinion (such as the phallas reference in ""The Little Mermaid."" I slowed the frames down and the referenced section is clearly the minister's knee).  Obviously, this is the proper role of the urban legend, and this is another strong point of the work in that the reader can choose to let his interpretation continue after being presented with opposing facts.  It is all in fun but sometimes the ultimate truth is NOT in the ear of the individual but the uniformed listener.  The writing style is very engaging and is not like the typical rock history that reads as historical fiction or is as dry as an encyclopedia reference.  As readers, we form our own opinions.  I suppose my definition of a ""hack' is someone who attacks a work and clearly misses the purpose of the work itself.  Maybe that is what is wrong with the media today, but we can only hope that a volume of rock and roll obitiaries makes it way to a bookstore soon--but don't bet on it--it's been done and overdone.If you ever liked ""The Twilight Zone"", ""Thriller"", and ""Night Gallery"", and if you ever enjoyed sitting around a campfire at night listening to ghost stories and tales of the unexplained, or if you'd like to be the life of the party in your knowledge of fascinating rock trivia, this book is for you.

13,Amazon,,"This is the best book I have read on the tragic Greek-Turkish ""population exchange"" of the 1920s. I found the book remarkable for several reasons: One is its organization. Chapters alternate between diplomatic history and human suffering stories, many of them based on interviews with survivors of that era. This has a powerful effect on the reader who sees how people were dying while ""diplomats talked."" Another is its fairness in discussing the responsibilities of each side. (The official Greek and Turkish positions place all the blame on the other side.) And finally the coverage of the suffering of the Muslims that were sent from Greece to Turkey as part of the ""exchange."" As the books states on p. 161 ""In most cases, the fate of these migrants was not as terrible as that of the Anatolian Christians who fled either in the heat of war, or as a result of forced marches followed by forced embarkations on ships riddled with disease; but the Muslim exodus was bad enough.""I have a special interest in the history of the region because both of my parents were born in Turkey and their families ended up in Greece as part of the exchange. My mother's family had to flee with a few hours notice following the retreating Greek army so they would not be slaughtered by Turkish irregulars. My father's family were Cappadocian Turkish speaking Christians. While their departure was more orderly they found themselves strangers in their new country. About 10 years or so ago I met a young Turkish college student who had a summer job in a hotel. He spoke some Greek and I asked him how he learned it. He told me his grandparents were Greek speaking Muslims from Crete and he described the difficulties they had in adjusting in Turkey, a story that mirrored exactly that of my father's family. I also realized that his grandparents must have had fond memories of Greece to teach their grandson the language. For what it is worth, what Clark describes seems to fit exactly my personal experience and my family's oral history.The final chapter of the book, ""The price of success"", is particularly noteworthy and I would recommend it even to those who have no special interest in Greece or Turkey. Clark points out that in a way the ""exchange"" was a success, despite its huge human cost. It allowed Greece and Turkey to become nation states that lived more or less peacefully side by side because of ""good fences."" But then he goes on to show that such fences are not viable and the linking of religion and ethnicity is a dangerous policy. In the case of Greece and Turkey a new conflict arose because of Cyprus and the two countries came close to war again. Finally, he shows how futile is trying to maintain ethnic and religious homogeneity in the modern era of globalization and extensive labor migration.It sad to see today that ethnic cleansing (based on one's religion) continues whether in the former Yugoslavia or in Iraq.

19,Amazon,,"  No one writes about Europe in the years just before World War II as beautifully and evocatively as Alan Furst. These are spy stories, but not of the James Bond variety.  Furst' spies are ordinary people. They undertake dangerous missions against fascist Germany and Italy because they love their own countries, a patriotism that would be lost on far too many Americans today or, for that matter, Western Europeans as well.  These are ordinary men and women who love their homelands even though Furst novels, they have often been forced to leave them. They also love freedom and are reluctantly willing to sacrifice their lives in pursuit of it.  Furst novels are not filled with physical action. There is little in the way of thrilling chases; almost nothing in the way of rip-roaring gun battles, martial arts melees or any other kind of violence.  Furst excels in painting the gray mood of Europe in the 1930s. People in France and Britain moved about in willful ignorance, believing they could wish Hitler and Mussolini away. English students signed declarations that they would not fight for their country. The French public allowed their elites to create the fractious political environment that would see France defeated in weeks in 1940.  Meanwhile, some people fled Germany and Italy, seeking a safe harbor while at the same time fighting back. Carlo Weisz is one of them. The scene is Paris in 1938. Weisz has fled Italy, works for Reuters in Paris and helps publish an underground resistance newspaper which is distributed in Italy.  Furst beautifully captures the hopes of the refugees, that their tiny resistance newspaper will keep ignite the fight against fascism (which was actually lost in 1922), knowing all the time that their efforts are futile. Furst paints sad portraits of the emigre existence; the chemist eking out a living now as a clerk in a department store; the former lawyer reduced to a clerical job. The Italian secret service, OVRA, murders one of this group to send a message: do not resist.  Carlo Weisz, bit by bit, is drawn into the orbit of the British SIS. Along the way, while covering the Spanish Civil War, he meets another Italian, a soldier who is fighting the fascists in Spain. Weisz covers events in Berlin as well, where he rekindles a romance with a former, now married, lover who, conveniently enough, is an anti-Nazi.  Furst does not hurry his story along. The pedestrian plotting adds to the oppressive atmosphere as Furst' characters - along with millions of others - are drawn inexorably to their destinies.  Weisz finally has no choice but to risk a return to Italy where he is a wanted man.  The story is slow, deliberately so. The characters are finely drawn. There are no happy people in a Furst novel. The plots are fairly intricate, but there are no holes to jar the reader.  Furst is a master of this period, his stories guaranteed to make the reader feel sadness for nearly every one of the ordinary people who are the ""good guys"" in his novels, but also a sense of awe for their willingness to fight for freedom even when the odds appear impossible and the battle hopeless.

25,Amazon,,"Wow! I'm so glad that one publisher has seen fit to collect such a stunning collection of the great but shockingly under-published weird fictionist Clark Ashton Smith in this excellent and affordable paperback. This really is one of the best anthologies of CAS's work currently on the market, including most of the best shorts from his fertile period at Weird Tales. Notable exceptions include ""Maze of the Enchanter"", ""Devotee of Evil"", and ""Monster of the Prophecy"" which are three of my personal favorites, and it would have been nice to have had the full version of his epic poem ""The Hashish Eater"" (of which only a fragment is printed), but on the whole I am thrilled with what is in these pages.If you're new to Clark Ashton Smith's work then this is surely one of the very best places to start. A famous friend and peer of HP Lovecraft, and respected poet in his own right, Smith's prose is rich with sensuous imagery of alien worlds and decadent cultures, of monstrous sorcerers and insane gods, of loathly creatures  and heavenly maidens. Yet there is an undeniably blackly humorous vein running throughout his work, and our heroes (if such they can be named) are often bumbling, greedy, cruel, or overly inquisitive persons who invariably come to a sticky end of their own making. Admirers of Lord Dunsany and The Arabian Nights will find much to enjoy here. ""The Werid of Avoosl Wuthoqquan"" and ""The Tale of Satampra Zeiros"" are quirky little tales where greed and curiosity lead the heroes eventually to a place 'they do not want to be.' ""The Double Shadow"" and ""Ubbo Sathla"" tell of the dangers of delving too deeply into forbidden knowledge, and the things that may be made manifest as a result. ""The Dark Eidolon"", one of the best pieces here, is a fantastically epic tale of revenge that spirals into an ever more insane cycle of vengeance and malice. There are also some very fine contemporary (1930s) horror pieces here. ""The Return of the Sorcerer"", ""The Nameless Offspring"", ""The Seed from the Sepulcher"" and several others are all frmly in the Lovecraft manner, and help to break up what would otherwise be a nauseously rich diet of weirdness. Finally, there is an excellent afterword by Stephen Jones that chronicles Smith's life and work, his inspirations and those he inspired.Full contents:On Fantasy (essay)Song of the Necromancer (poem)Abominations of YondoNinth SkeletonLast IncantationA Rendezvous in AveroignReturn of the SorcererTale of Satampra ZeirosDoor to SaturnThe GorgonWeird of Avoosl WuthoqquanNameless OffspringEmpire of the NecromancersHunters from BeyondIsle of the TorturersBeast of AveroignGenius-LociUbbo-SathlaKiss of ZoraidaSeed from the SepulcherWeaver in the VaultThe GhoulThe Charnel God Death of MalygrisTomb-SpawnSeven GeasesXeethraThe Dark EidolonFlower-WomenTreader of the DustBlack Abbot of PuthuumNecromancy in NaatDeath of IllalothaGarden of AdomphaMother of ToadsDouble ShadowComing of the White WormRoot of AmpoiMorthyllaAn Offering to the MoonTheft of the Thirty-Nine GirdlesSymposium of the GorgonTold in the DesertPrince Alcouz and the magicianA Good EmbalmerThe MortuaryAfterword: The Lost Worlds of Klarkash-Ton by Stephen Jones (essay",long,3200,499,good,suboptimal,good,"This really is one of the best anthologies of CAS 's work currently on the market , including most of the best shorts from his fertile period at Weird Tales .<q>A famous friend and peer of HP Lovecraft , and respected poet in his own right , Smith 's prose is rich with sensuous imagery of alien worlds and decadent cultures , of monstrous sorcerers and insane gods , of loathly creatures and heavenly maidens .<q>I 'm so glad that one publisher has seen fit to collect such a stunning collection of the great but shockingly under-published weird fictionist Clark Ashton Smith in this excellent and affordable paperback .","This really is one of the best anthologies of CAS 's work currently on the market , including most of the best shorts from his fertile period at Weird Tales .

It kind of put all the pieces together for me.  The early chapters are very revealing because as a white kid of nine years old in the fifties, I had only heard of the places mentioned in the book.

You MUST read this series and it runs as follows:CAUGHT STEALINGSIX BAD THINGSA DANGEROUS MANHank Thompson is back and he is bad.  But he does NOT want to be bad.  His entire life is controlled by the Russian mob.  He hates his life, but will do anything (and does!) to insure his parents are kept alive.  Yes, if Hank does not do what the mob wants his parents will be killed.  So, Hank turns into a killer for the love and the sake of his parents.  What a guy!What all started with baby sitting for his neighbor's cat turns Hank's life into a nightmare.  In this final installment Hank is ordered to be a bodyguard if you will to a new minor league baseball star, Miguel and Miguel's life-long friend, Jay.  YO!Miguel is all and has all that Hank never achieved in his own life.  Hank should have been/could have been a big league baseball star.  Fate changes that for him.  Hank takes an instant liking to the two young men, and they are off and running. The party scenes and baseball games will have you laughing.  Hank is very good with his wit and sarcasm, traits of his that I adore.  The three of them run into all sorts of problems, but manage to have fun.  All three of them form a friendship.  What I admired about Hank is while he knew that Miguel's life could have been his own life he never felt or showed any type of jealously.  Their friendship is firm.With the mob constantly watching Hank, keeping him under tabs, having him be a hitman for them, hurting people, killing people, Hank's life literally SUCKS.  His entire life goes against the grain of his soul.  He has had BAD plastic surgery on his face and is in constant pain.  He has lost his friends, family, and his former life.  What he hasn't lost is his heart and soul or his love of life.The action never stops, the writing is wonderful, the characters are good when they should be and nasty when they have to be.  Hank is a great character and one I will truly miss since this series is finished now.  Mr. Huston has a winner with these three books and they should not be missed.The character of Hank -- down on his luck, living a horrible life, good man turn killer, former almost big league ball player, former bartender - he is a true winner.  You will love this guy.  For some reason, I kept picturing Hugh Laurie from HOUSE being Hank.  What a great idea for a MOVIE.  These three books would make a kick butt movie.Speaking of kicking butt, that is what this series does.  You will enjoy it and must read these books.  When I first ran across these books, they seemed like books men would enjoy, but every lady I know that has read them -- including me -- has LOVED them.Do yourself a favor and read these books.  Also, don't miss Mr. Huston's other book, ALREADY DEAD.  If you enjoy vampire books, this one rocks.  It is unlike anything vampire you have ever read.  Joe Pitt, the main character, like Hank Thompson, has one thing -- ATTTITUDE.READ THEM and ENJOY.Thank you!

Recognized as an up and coming hotshot young magician, Nathaniel (known only as John Mandrake to his colleagues) is appointed the youngest ever Assistant to the Head of Internal Affairs and charged with the elimination of the bothersome Resistance. Nathaniel, initially cocky and confident that he can rid the government of this pesky Resistance problem in short order discovers he is up against sterner stuff than he had anticipated.Deadly sharks, senior ministers in the government intensely angry and jealous of Nathaniel's rising star, circle quickly and close in for the kill as Nathaniel runs into roadblocks and fails to shut down the Resistance as ordered. Kitty and her fellow Resistance members seem uncannily able to thwart Nathaniel's best efforts at every turn. Nathaniel's future and, indeed, his very life seem in jeopardy when a Golem runs on a destructive rampage through London. Everyone except Nathaniel is convinced that the Resistance is behind the unleashing of the Golem and blame quickly falls on Nathaniel for the continuing mayhem.The fast-paced narrative shifts point of view with every chapter, rotating from Nathaniel through Kitty, the young fiery heroine who lives life on the run with her fellow Resistance members, and Bartimaeus, the acerbic, witty djinni who continues to regale us with his clever, barbed but dead on point observations. Even though Stroud has produced a plot that never flags and pulls us along at an almost breakneck pace, ""The Golem's Eye"" is still a much darker, gloomier, minutely detailed and more atmospheric novel than its predecessor. The dominant theme is very clearly the corrupting influences of power, ambition and greed and the reader is left mourning flawed Nathaniel's fall from grace wondering whether he can find the moral strength and intestinal fortitude to re-assert himself as the fine young man we left far behind in ""The Amulet of Samarkand"". Despite this rather more gothic approach to the story than its predecessor, readers need not worry that Stroud has lost his flair for comedy. Footnotes, while not quite as plentiful as in the first novel, are still a veritable fountain of wit. One scene in particular in which Bartimaeus destroys an incredibly valuable artifact in the British Museum thinking it to be merely a sign with a set of written rules for the museum patrons is laugh out loud hilarious.The resolution of the plot line revolving around Gladstone's magical staff and the rampaging Golem provide a perfect opportunity for Stroud to bring this particular novel to a close. But it is quite clear that Nathaniel, now reduced to the status of a failing anti-hero, and Kitty, the charming yet resolute young commoner and apparently sole survivor of her Resistance cell will butt heads once again with Bartimaeus who, for the moment, has been dismissed to his spirit world.""Ptolemy's Gate"" awaits although I'm not sure I can!Paul Weis",long,3175,509,neutral,neutral,neutral,"Having successfully thwarted Simon Lovelace 's ill-fated conspiracy in `` The Amulet of Samarkand '' , Nathaniel is `` adopted '' by Jessica Whitwell , Security Minister in Britain 's dark and oppressive government by magic and begins life anew in `` The Golem 's Eye '' .<q>Recognized as an up and coming hotshot young magician , Nathaniel ( known only as John Mandrake to his colleagues ) is appointed the youngest ever Assistant to the Head of Internal Affairs and charged with the elimination of the bothersome Resistance .<q>Everyone except Nathaniel is convinced that the Resistance is behind the unleashing of the Golem and blame quickly falls on Nathaniel for the continuing mayhem.The fast-paced narrative shifts point of view with every chapter , rotating from Nathaniel through Kitty , the young fiery heroine who lives life on the run with her fellow Resistance members , and Bartimaeus , the acerbic , witty djinni who continues to regale us with his clever , barbed but dead on point observations .","Having successfully thwarted Simon Lovelace 's ill-fated conspiracy in `` The Amulet of Samarkand '' , Nathaniel is `` adopted '' by Jessica Whitwell , Security Minister in Britain 's dark and oppressive government by magic and begins life anew in `` The Golem 's Eye '' .

34,Amazon,,"This book provides a wonderful and comprehensive introduction to genetics. I'm not a biology major, but I found that this book is both entertaining and informative. The author describes a wide panoramic view on the genetics, and yet addresses the fundamental concepts in genetics in very clear manner. DNA structure, replication, transcription to RNA, RNA processing, and RNA translation (a.k.a. the central dogma) have been very hard to comprehend and visualize, yet the author explains it very well. Numerous detailed illustrations in the book really helps to clarify the central dogma.All chapters start with VERY compelling REAL-WORLD cases that tantalizes you on learning the subject presented in the chapter. That makes me wanting to read for more. The writing is concise and clear. The author clearly knows his stuff.Overall, it is a great intro book. Great for both self-learners and in-class students. Definitely a must buy for those who want to get acquainted in genetics.For in depth contents: The book seems to be divided into four parts.1. It starts with principles of classical (Mendelian) genetics with its applications on chapter 1. Then it goes into cell structures, functions, and reproduction with chapter 2-4. Followed by heredity principles of reproduction and how classical genetics fit into the analysis of hereditary traits. The next chapter discusses how classical genetics is not enough -- the author presents compelling cases like lethal alleles, incomplete penetration, and so forth in chapter 5-6. This limitation brings forth extensions and modifications on the basic principles, which is also discussed. The author also discusses other analyses to detect hereditary traits, such as pedigree analysis.2. The second part is more toward modern genetics: How genes are not independently assorted as the Mendelian principles dictates. The concept of linkage, recombination, and consequently gene mapping are discussed in chapter 7. Followed by Chapter 8 is sort of intermezzo on bacterial and viral genetic systems.3. The third part is the meat of the book:Chapter 9 discusses what chromosomes are and how chromosomes abnormalities occur and what type of abnormalities.Chapter 10 discusses about DNA and RNA structure, followed by chromosome structure in chapter 11.Chapter 12 discusses DNA replication and recombination with detailed illustrations.Chapter 13 discusses transcription process, followed by chapter 14 on RNA molecules and processing.Chapter 15 discusses about genetic code and translation, followed by chapter 16: Gene expression.Chapter 17 discusses gene mutations and DNA repair.4.

37,Amazon,,"[...]   If you are curious about the Cambridge Patonists, Patrides carefully edited selection of texts gives you the cream of the crop! - Benjamin Whichcote, Ralph Cudworth, John Smith, Henry More et al. - material reprinted from the original texts, complete with all the archaic but fascinating English spellings. The texts are fully annotated with comparisons and references to a wide range of cognate works.  If you are reading the Cambridge Platonists as part of an academic exercise or are otherwise familiar with their milieu, well and good. You will know what to expect. I think it is worth saying something here - for the general reader. I am sufficiently 'unmodern' (or perhaps 'un-postmodernist') toread the Cambridge Platonists because I think they still have something valuable to say!  Not everyone would agree with me - but, I think the portrait of Benjamin Whichcote which graces the cover of this book (and the frontispiece) says something about the sort of men we are dealing with. (The portrait still hangs in the gallery at Emmanuel College, Cambridge). There is composure in that expression. It seems to infuse the whole being of the man. It is the expression of a mind which has found calm waters,seen eternal verities.   One of the papers in this book - Ralph Cudworth's, was preached as a Sermon Before the House of Commons (i.e. the British Parliament). Things are different with us today. We are no longer certain of eternal verities. It seems almost incomprehensible - now, to think that when the Cambridge Platonists were expounding their ideas in the 17th c., they were touching on matters of concern to most thinking people.Religion and science had not yet parted company (despite being called a 'father of modern science' in school books, Issac Newton was a deeply religious man, very much in tune with the ideas of the Cambridge Platonists).    The great beauty of the Cambridge Platonists, is their calm confidence, their utter conviction that there are eternal verities, that Reason and Faith are complementary faculties. Thus, on the one hand, they looked back to the philosophers of antiquity (strictly speaking, they are Neo-Platonists, taking in everything between Plato, Plotinus, Ficino/Renaissance thought, even Hermeticism) - and the legacy of Christianity, while on the other hand - they were alive to the emerging 'scientific' spirit, the renewed quest to understand the principles ordering the phenomenal universe. For them, there was an Intelligent - and intelligible order in the universe. For them, Reason (capital R) still had its pre-Kantian, classical sweep. 'Reason' was not a mere idea in the head, an itching in the cranium, but presupposed the divine Nous (intellect), intimately connected with the activity of a divine energy (energeia)informing the pattern of the universe. We find them preaching against false religious 'enthusiasm' - as soundly as they preached against atheism.      ""Good men spiritualise their bodies; bad men do       incarnate their souls. ""      ""We are no more than Second causes; and our      Suffiency is only in God, who is the First.      A Second Cause is no Cause, divided from       the First.

39,Amazon,,"Often times mentioning ""The Phantom of the Opera"" ellicits snickers from theatre purists who see the musical as a somewhat ridiculously overblown slightly stupid story which all seems too far fetched to be taken seriously. I confess, I first fell in love with the story when I saw Andrew Lloyd Webber's rendition of the show (which I've seen about five times now) - a show which I now realize that if taken by itself, tends to be a somewhat ridiculously overblown slightly stupid story which seems too far fetched to be taken seriously. The original book changes everything.Not only does the book contain the story of Erik, the Opera Ghost, but it also includes some of Leroux's own research into the story which he claims as true. Not only does he make this somewhat extrodinary claim to the truth of the story, but he in rather fine detail shows how there was really nothing supernatural at all about the story: even the seeming supernatural elements all have simple solutions: many of which Leroux himself found the 'keys' to while doing research for the book. The book blows the musical away. Like sand-blasting a soup craker. But before I say more I will say that the musical picks up on many of the important parts of the book: that is to say, I would recommend reading the book and getting to know the story well, because then even though the musical only picks up on many of the important parts and not all, you'll know the rest of the story: and suddenly the musical won't be a somewhat ridiculously overblown slightly stupid story which seems too far fetched to be taken seriously - it's actually very believable. Admittedly, it would have been far too difficult to make the entire story into a musical: but let me whet your appetite for the fuller details of this incredible love story by touching on a few of the most important difference between the book and the musical.1. One of the most important characters from the book is gone from the musical. The very mysterious character called simply ""The Persian"" is not only Erik's one confidant in the book, but he also serves as a link between Erik and other people involved in the Opera. In the musical, Madam Giry represents both her role in the book, and The Persian. (I.e., in the musical, Madam Giry leads Raoul down to Erik's home under the Opera House: in the book, it's actually The Persian who does). 2. There is yet another character, simply called ""A Shade"" who also appears breifly in the book...a brief part, but actually quite dark.3. Erik's brilliance as a ventriloquist is lost in the musical but fully explained and examined in the book4. The most intriging part of the book, Erik's six-mirrored 'tourture chamber' - a major part of the story and a powerful demonstration of Erik's brilliance as a fearsome foe is completely missing from the musical. This is easily my favourite book that I've ever read, and I recommend it to people all the time. Read it and enjoy it!

Unitarianism has replaced prayers at breakfast with wholesome food.  The book is cool and funny.  Nathaniel Alden is an awful snob and is supernaturally quiet and unengaged.  He has vowed to abstain from carriage travel and so must walk.  He lives in Boston in the Back Bay.  His younger brother Peter is being sent to camp in the west prior to beginning preparation for Harvard at Exeter.  The camp life in Wyoming is to Peter a godsend after living under the dictates of Nathaniel.  Genuine cowboys would sometimes ride into the camp.  Peter grows up to attend Harvard and to acquire a medical degree.  He never practices medicine.  His son Oliver is born.  His wife is from Great Falls, Connecticut.  Oliver manages to escape almost all the ills of childhood.  He has a foreign governess, a German woman.While boating with his father, Oliver is given THE LEAVES OF GRASSS to read.  Oliver and his father visit an old kinsman, Caleb Wetherbee.  During the winter Caleb resides on Mount Vernon Street on Beacon Hill.  He is a cripple and has adopted the Catholic religion and has become highly knowledgeable about European matters.  He invites Oliver to to participate in his Sunday evening parties when Oliver attends Harvard.  Observers find Caleb's deep religious interests to be a clear case of sublimation.Olivers's mother is apt to take no notice of genius or style, she is concerned with social propriety.  Oliver, invited by his father to spend a year abroad, makes a decision to stay at his day school in Connecticut and live with his mother for the final year before college.  He also decides that Williams College is good enough for him.  He fears that universities are filled with snobs.  Football more than anything else restores Oliver's conventional tone after spending time with his father and his father's companion Jim.  Oliver does spend the summer with his father and learns that his will has been ripped up and that the older man fears he is dying.  Oliver promises Jim he will take care of him notwithstanding the fact that some of Jim's conduct shocks him.  Oliver learns to punt.  He meets his cousin Mario at Eton.  Mario's grandmother is Peter Alden's sister.  Oliver and Peter are detained at Eton when Peter falls ill.  Peter is pleased to see that his son is so wide awake intellectually.  Oliver feels a need to justify his natural sympathies theoretically.  Peter dies.Two years later Mario and Oliver see each other in Manhattan and in Cambridge.  Both of the cousins are attending Harvard.  Oliver, spending three years at Williams, suffers a football injury and decides to rededicate himself to his studies in the wider academic setting of Harvard.  Oliver never flinches in his determination to pursue higher things.  At Harvard through chance Oliver occupies the room occupied previously by Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Santayana himself is a character in this tale, a member of the philosophy department at Harvard.  Oliver joins in the fighting of World War I.  He is described as an ascetic without faith.  When Oliver dies, Mario is the executor of Oliver's will.

The conversation turned to poverty and I started giving ideas from a book I was reading by a popular economist who hangs out with Bono and predicted an end to world poverty in 20 years if we just give a bit more, and in a smarter way, to poor countries. The older gentleman sitting next to me said, ""That's completely wrong!"" and started to explain how much America has given with such poor results. Of course, I'm not one to be put off, so I said (as the famous economist had said) that America hadn't really given nearly as much as was committed and as I started to explain, the gentleman more loudly said, ""That's completely wrong!!"" Then he spoke for about ten minutes, explaining how capitalism without a foundation of moral stability (such as the new Russia) almost always fails. I had to agree with that. Then he spoke about how just learning the rules of business isn't enough, how people who have their hearts changed by a relationship with Jesus do so much better in capitalism. I had to agree with that too.Till he was done talking, I'd completely refuted everything I'd previously said and was agreeing with him wholeheartedly, knowing how dopey that made me look. As he wound down, he looked at me and said, ""Sorry I got so enthusiastic there, I've just written a book on the subject and am pretty excited about it."" Debby and I laughed and laughed as we remembered the situation, as did the others at the table. Me just plodding along, trying to explain the situation to a world expert. Oh well, at least it's not boring being me.As I read the book written by my breakfast companion, Ken Eldred, I was amazed by both his background and the fundamental shift in world missions he predicts. He examines the model of traditional missionaries, looking at the high cost, the number of countries where they are not welcome and how there are often hard feelings by locals about rich foreigners living in their area with no visible means of support. I've struggled with these problems regarding traditional missions as well. He also notes the sense of diminishing returns from traditional missions. On the other hand, almost every country wants economic development. He postulates that businesses run by Christians can affect an incredible numbers of lives. These Kingdom businesses work toward a triple bottom line: profits and sustainability; local jobs and wealth creation; and advancing local church and building spiritual capital (honesty, service, excellence, respect, commitment, value, trust, loyalty and quality). These Kingdom businesses may be tiny one-person operations or huge companies, but this important trend could be one of the greatest mission endeavors ever. He outlines the many ways business people can be involved in this type of work.

50,Amazon,,"Few history books will ever have a more immediate and visceral impact on a reader; this is a chronicle of horror, bravery, hate, love and uncertainty woven into a rich tapestry of human endeavor at the absolute limit of comprehension.  The authors have put stark human faces on one of the great acts of treachery and inhumanity of the Third Reich.  In the brutal winter of 1944-45 the Germans began moving over 200,000 allied POWs from the advancing Russian armies toward the west, for reasons not certain even today.  The particular ordeals of POWs from a selected number of the camps are described in riveting detail, with the personalities and actions of key POW participants richly revealed in  often first-hand accounts and from recent interviews and testimony.  It is almost unreal the depth of depravity inflicted by the Germans, particularly the SS, on these marches, some hundreds of miles long and lasting over several months. It seems incomprehensible that as a signatory to the Geneva Convention and a generally Christian nation that the Germans could be so uncaring of fellow humans; and as badly as the American and British POWs suffered, the treatment of the Russian prisoners will leave the reader profoundly disturbed.  The authors follow the main characters throughout the ordeal and in many cases through the happiness and disappointments they faced after liberation.  The book is carefully constructed so that as events unfold on the ground the reader is given the backdrop of actions by the governments and military hierarchies of the USA, UK, Soviet Union and Germany which help to explain the cascading events leading to the tragedy.  Like a really good novel, the books gives us a look at the aftermath, when both heroes and scoundrels get what they deserve, or, all too often, what they don't deserve.  Readers will find themselves cheering on the good guys and screaming invective at the bad guys and there are many of them, on both sides of the wire.

51,Amazon,,"The premise of this book is: what would have happened to the history of the world if the Roman Empire had never fallen? Giving Robert Silverberg the benefit of the doubt: rewriting the entire history of the world is a difficult thing to do. However, because of that most people wouldn't try it.The book would have been better as a collection of short stories. Each chapter is a story in itself, and then history normally jumps 300 years and all the characters who were in the last chapter are, clearly, dead. Another annoying thing about this method is that each chapter he has one of the characters recap the entire history of the Roman Empire, including all the chapters that you just finished reading.Silverberg is also pretty inconsistent in certain things. First, he tries to Romanize all the place names in the beginning to the point that sometimes you don't know where he's talking about. But then on the next page he mentions the German boarder. Not only that, but when they discover the New World (a.k.a., Nova Roma) they come across Mexico and Peru. Also, later in the book he talks about how ""Londin and Parisi"" were major cities. I'm not that up on Roman history, but were those really the names of those cities during the Roman Empire?There's also a bunch of historical inconsistencies. He wants to rewrite history as if the Roman Empire never fell, but yet there is still a ""medieval"" period (complete with knighthood) and a Renaissance. The Renaissance doesn't make sense because if there was no real ""Dark Ages,"" how can they have a Renaissance? However, if I recall correctly, the whole concept of knighthood was part of the feudal system that arose as a form of organization once the Roman Empire fell. WWI and WWII also happen around the same times, but under the names of the First and Second Wars of Reunificantion. However, he's also somewhat inconsistent about what these wars refer to, having the Second War of Reunification refer first to subduing fights in the outer provinces and in the next chapter having it refer to the founding of the Second Republic. He's also inconsistent in the numbering of Emperors. For example, all of a sudden he has Trajan VII who is from Hispania and yet somehow even though it's special enough to mention that he's from Hispania, his name is still the same as six other Emperors before him, also you cannot seem to figure out when these people ever ruled. Not to mention my annoyance at the fact that the languages in Europe develop in exactly the same way that they did, which I'm not entirely sure would have happened if the Roman Empire hadn't fallen.A big part of my annoyance comes from his treatment of the Hebrews. First of all, Silverberg is clearly of the belief that the Roman Empire fell because of the Christians. So how can he make Christianity not start in the first place? Well, clearly by having the Exodus fail and the Hebrews remain slaves in Egypt. Of course something that I realized toward the end of the book is that he refers to the Hebrews having followed the Law. If they never left Egypt, how did they get this Law? Not only that but I found it offensice that he portrays the Hebrews as being greedy and miserly with their money. He says that the Hebrews have a ""knack for finance"" (87) and one of the Hebrew characters in the first chapter is the only one ""who kept the strings of his purse drawn tight"" (28) while others are giving money to street entertainers. That stereotype arose in the Middle Ages because the Church restricted Jews to being moneylenders. However, (a) that's after the point in the story that the book starts at and (b) the stereotype would not have have been created if the the Roman Empire hadn't fallen. Yet Silverberg treats that stereotype as truth, and I find that offensive",long,3788,669,good,suboptimal,neutral,"Giving Robert Silverberg the benefit of the doubt : rewriting the entire history of the world is a difficult thing to do .<q>He wants to rewrite history as if the Roman Empire never fell , but yet there is still a `` medieval '' period ( complete with knighthood ) and a Renaissance .<q>Each chapter is a story in itself , and then history normally jumps 300 years and all the characters who were in the last chapter are , clearly , dead .","Giving Robert Silverberg the benefit of the doubt : rewriting the entire history of the world is a difficult thing to do .

54,Amazon,,"I did enjoy The Notebook, however this conceited tale of two uncultured Americans left me with a less than stellar opinion of Sparks and his equally conceited brother.Firstly, I found it amazing that such educated parents were so idiotic when it came to the basics of childrearing. Their lack of attention to their children's health and well being was outright neglect! Who doesn't take their child to the dentist or doctor? If you can't afford them, then DON'T have them is my thought-and I was raised Catholic-his mother waited too long before she wised up and used birth control.What really got to me was the dorky banter between the two brothers. For men who are around six years older than me, their patriarchal value system is outdated and quite shocking. They seem to think women should remain barefoot and pregant, maintaining the homestead while they galavant around the world. They obviously picked some pretty simple minded women for their wives because you wouldn't catch me or any of my friends staying back home to take care of a litter of screaming kids while our sexist husbands travel the world.As a child I was lucky enough to travel the world extensively and visited Ayers rock several times as a child living in South Australia. No wonder Americans have such a poor reputation around the world if the majority of them act like these two troglodytes. I was five years old the first time I visited Uluru and the Olgas and was fascinated by the stories and aboriginal culture and I can assure you we DID NOT have a luxury hotel in which to rest our laurels.

Their lack of proper upbringing is very evident throughout the book and unfortunately they have joined the masses of other noveau riche who may have newly padded wallets, but have empty brains.

Could this be a help in organizing my knowledge about debuggers, collected so far from semi confidential industry reports or white papers, 3-4 dissertations, several implementations, plus some 10-15 conference papers with vague descriptions of implementations, claims of spectacular achievements or with mere theoretical ideas?No, unfortunately this is not so. This book, or rather ""a booklet"" is very incomplete. It literally did not told me any single detail which I would not have known already. For example, missing is the description of the very standard Unix interface to control and hold a process. Since this is not a scientific book providing more generic foundations about process tracing (such as tracking of very long time running programs, replay techniques, generating snapshots etc. etc.) than I would at least expect a solid practice orientation. This should include a complete discussion of several assemblers and typical architectures, because they provide sometimes completely different means of implementing breakpoints, watchpoints or of support for threads. In many cases a debugger must be, or can be supported by a cooperating compiler. Several interesting ideas have been implemented in the back ends, which may greatly help supporting breakpoints, finding function prologues, dealing with exceptions and asynchronous signals. I also miss the specifications and a good comparison of the two most common formats holding symbolic information, Stabs and DWARF!

62,Amazon,,"This ""book"" is probably the worst written I've ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered literature. Alice Walker tries to ""One-up"" Harriet Beecher Stowe, in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell. The only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. I've learned long ago, when absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at work. There are no ""real"" men in this book! Only distorted caricatures of Black masculinity. I only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. I find this title as dangerous as Hitler's ""Mien Kampf"", in it's portrayal of Black men as evil and morally destitute. Presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. True, there are criminally abusive men in every culture. But there are also forthright, upstanding  men as well. To present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about. Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. This title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of Black Men. This book is fiction. However,it is not presented as such. I'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. I have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. However, I do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. That is what I find so unbelievable and offensive about this book. In my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. I don't find it a testament to the strength of Black Women at all. I interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of African-American culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the Black Male as being hopelessly inhuman.I'm sure Alice walker made a lot of money with this book. Feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. I wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades, were it a fictional depiction of White American Men brutalizing White Women. Most definitely not!!! I doubt it would have even found a publisher. America is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of Black Men and African-American culture.My life as a Black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion.

Don't expect anything like this; however, from Richard Gerber - the guy is a real QUACK! I originally had high hopes for this book - with the topic being ""vibrational medicine"" there is an incredible wealth of information on all kinds of related topics - including the complete sound spectrum and the electromagnetic continuum. Obviously an enormous amount of time could be spent on  examining such readily (and empirically) identifiable uses of such waveforms but that seems to be expecting far too much from Gerber.Instead of science, Gerber decides to spew forth endless pages of New Age quackery beginning with a seemingly never-ending discourse on chakra's and other such garbage. He refers to ""research"" conducted by clairvoyants, psychics, faith healers, ""medical intuitives"",  and a whole plethora of other euphemisms as the basis for his drivel. This appears to be designed to legitimize the fact that he can't support the bizarre ideas he presents.While one can't help but wonder if Gerber must have missed his thorazine when he wrote this nonsense, he covers many of the most ridiculous modalities of ""healing"" but ignores many, many valid ones. For example, Gerber doesn't even mention the use of sound - a treatment modality that has found uses in essentially every culture and yet he goes into such bizarre topics as long distance ""color therapy"" where the healer merely ""thinks"" of a color while projecting his/her healing thought upon a patient who happens to be miles away.In fact, this book contains so much meaningless tripe that it might be best to sum it up by hypothesizing a visit to Gerber's ""medical"" practice.   For example: suppose you are in the midst of a massive heart attack. After reading this book, it is easy to imagine that Gerber would tell you that his on-staff ""medical intuitive"" took the day off in order to find some more snake oil. As a result, he needs to call the psychic hotline first (because he can't read your aura) and will need the so-called clairvoyant at the other end of the line bathe you in ""indigo"" in order to unblock your chakras. Let's not forget that you will need to be facing west, during your heart attack, and have magnets placed upon your chest as you sniff the essence of dandelions that have been fermented in a green room (shaped like a pyramid, of course).While there are so many promising approaches to healing that use legitmate techniques for overcoming sickness, books like this do nothing but harm those who are doing real research into alternative medicine modalities.

This argument I can accept.  However, the author has picked the CFR as some grand body that rules American policy and has done so for years  with the evil intent of creating a one-world government.  If you were to believe everything in this book you would assume that all American foreign policy, all Presidents and most parts of American government have been ruled by this organization since it's founding in 1921.  The arguments do not ring true, the author has concluded that membership in this organization has somehow made members brain washed zombies of some grand master plan for one-world government.  However the author does not really explain why the membership would have such slavish devotion to this principle nor does he really explain why he feels that such a plan is so evil that is must be opposed.  Until of course the last two pages of the book when the author finally writes;"" 	In essence, history is the story of conflict.  Those who view history as a series of accidents, it is interesting to note, also usually believe that the universe itself began as an accident and that man resulted from the random molecular collisions....	 There are, however, those of us who accept the causality of God. Many centuries ago, the Hebrew Old Testament and the Christian New Testament prophesied that ultimately a beautiful kingdom will prevail.... But they also warned of an evil, one-world government.....	Many notables of the American Establishment have given themselves over to one side in this conflict, and it is not the side the ancient scriptures recommended.  Whether or not they are conspirators, whether they are conscious or not of the ultimate consequences of their actions, their powerful influence has helped move the world towards apocalyptic events.""And thus after 220 pages we see that there is no need to argue why the CFR is evil and what it is up to, this is all self evident by reading the Bible.  Which then begs the question why buy and then read this book when the argument has already been made in the Bible.  It would have been nice if the author had started with this paragraph rather than waiting to the last page, it may have made his arguments more coherent.  At least I would know that this was not to be a well argued scholarly work but an end of the world rant that assumes you have bought into ""The End is Near"" world view.  If you are not of this mind set then this book shows you that people like to get together when they think alike and form clubs that tend to push their ideas and promote their own members.  But then I went to college and experienced fraternities so I get the general idea already.  Overall this book was a waste of time, true believers will see it as more of the same evidence and skeptics will not be swayed by the weak arguments and faulty reasoning.",long,3308,579,neutral,neutral,neutral,"However , the author has picked the CFR as some grand body that rules American policy and has done so for years with the evil intent of creating a one-world government .<q>And thus organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations are born so that the wealthy and powerful can meet with other like minded people and expand their influence and push their ideas onto others .<q>There are , however , those of us who accept the causality of God .","And thus organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations are born so that the wealthy and powerful can meet with other like minded people and expand their influence and push their ideas onto others .

80,Amazon,,"I picked up this book as a way to familiarize myself with the changes to UML in UML 2.0, which are extensive, as I found the OMG specification nearly impenetrable. I had liked the first edition, though I too felt Fowler's Distilled was a much better intro to give to students and engineers learning UML for the first time. This edition, though, does not meet expectations. The typos and bad references throughout are bad enough. Join that with a complete lack of real-world design examples, poor organization, and poor design.  Why a chapter on State Machines and a separate chapter on State Diagrams that repeats a lot of the earlier chapter? The blue cross references make it clear that the book is spaghetti design at its worst. Check out the table of contents, you won't know where to look for your favorite diagrams; check out the index, and you won't be able to find the definition of the concept you just can't quite remember. The glossary is useful, as the UML 2.0 spec dispensed with a glossary, making it even more impenetrable. On the other hand, the authors make no attempt to call out the new UML 2.0 features, which would have made my day. What I find most unforgivable, though, is the authors' inability to present the new UML as it really is: the book is seriously misleading in many ways for learning UML 2.0. My biggest peeve is the way they treat the new and highly useful composite structure diagrams. In the list of diagrams, they don't even mention it, calling it by the name of a different diagram, the ""Component Diagram"", which they feel is the same thing. They then separate the discussion of composite classes and components, making it seem as though they're totally unrelated. They fail to mention quite a few of the new UML features (the X navigation adornments that make non-navigability explicit, for example, which is critical to code generation, or the fact that you can have multiple stereotypes associated with model elements. In their defense, the UML standard isn't very clear on these diagram types, but this is a practical tutorial that should take practice into account. There are constant references to the Reference Guide for more advanced features; these are mostly the UML 2.0 features that they didn't feel were important enough to include in the comprehensive tutorial.

81,Amazon,,"I really looked forward to this book after reading the review in The New Yorker.  The reviewer's critical skills, evidently, do not extend to evaluating the merits of a logical argument. There are so many logical problems with the analysis in this book, it is difficult to know where to begin.  I will limit myself to just a handful, among countless possibilities. 1) The authors find a correlation between the stability of a basketball team's roster and its winning percentage, and conclude that roster stability is a factor in producing wins! Classic problem of mistaking effect for cause.  Clearly, winning teams are disinclined to make major roster changes, and losing teams are eager to.  I was so amazed at this I reread it to see if I missed where they pointed this out.  They didn't. 2) The authors show a correlation between more assists and winning percentage and conclude that assists help produce wins.  Again, very silly.  A team with a higher shooting percentage and fewer turnovers will of course get more wins and produce more assists.  But the assists are not producing the wins - the shooting percentage is.  Were these factors discounted?  Not according to the text.  3) Most problematic, the authors define a way of measuring the value of players to a team, and then ""prove"" their method by summing these values, per player, across each team, and show  that they do indeed predict the number of wins each team will get.  What they fail to realize is that their method of apportioning value to a player necessarily sums back to team totals such as points per possession that we know correlate to wins per team.  But this in no way proves that the apportioning is wrong.  We could just as easily base each player's value ""team's points while players is on the floor - opposing team's points while player is in the floor"".  Sum for all players on team, and you will find the team's points-per-game and the opposition's points per game, and you have just ""proven"" that your method of measuring a player's value is accurate.  4.  In looking at rebounds, there is not even the slightest caveat that a player's rebounds per game are affected by who he shares rebounding responsibilities with.  If you are in the front court with Shaq, you will get fewer rebounds, not because the other team gets them, but because your teammate does, so comparing rebounding stats between players across teams is highly questionable.  5. Ridiculously, they conclude that adding great players to your roster makes the other players worse not better (this is written as a great revelation, demythifying the common presumption that great players make teammates better).  Adding great players indeed will make other players statistically less productive.  They will take fewer shots, get fewer rebounds, fewer assists if a new ball-handler is added, etc.  And so, according their evaluation method, the other players become worse.  This should clearly tell them there is something wrong with their system, based so heavily on specific metrics of productivity.  Instead, they simply accept the merit of their method as fact, and conclude that adding great players really makes other players worse!!!The most frustrating thing about this book, however, for an analytically minded reader, is its smugness.  They understand statistics. They have the answers.  They are bringing them down from the mountains and explaining them to us idiot peons.  All while their reasoning is so problematic. I in no way am a supporter of the intuitive and nonsensical drivel one hears from so many sports coaches, players and commentators.  I would have enjoyed a good, statistical, analytical study of the game of basketball.  Unfortunately, this is not it.

84,Amazon,,"Patti Smith has a life story so interesting and compelling that even an account this pedestrian and unispired is interesting at times. But that is because of the story of Patti Smith, rather than the writing here, which is barely above the level of the average People magazine article.The author failed to conduct a single interview with Smith for the book. His entire ""research"" consists of reading other people's work- other articles and books. Hence nothing is new here and nothing feels particularly incisive or accurate. The author prefers to list famous people who attended a performance, rather than offer any insight into what made that performance (the art itself) interesting or meaningful. He spends lots of time with catty references and lukewarm sexual gossip, and no time analizing what makes Smith's writing and performance so compelling year after year.There is also an ongoing series of refernces to Patti being ""mean"" to Debbie Harry, like the two are jealous high school cheerleaders rather than important women in rock. These refernces are utterly pointless. At the end of the book is the one interview the author ever did with Smith, in 1972 at her first poetry being published. Reading it entertaining, because you realize the author used every single word in the book itself, desperately trying to spread this pr puff piece long enough to make it seem as if he knows Smith and her world. Pathetic.This effort is particularly galling because Patti Smith herself did so much (and does so much today) to stretch boundaries, to make new connections, to reinvent her chosen art forms. How unflattering a contrast then, to have this ""biography"" be so utterly dull witted and pedantic. A National Enquirer article would be more insightful.The book also fails to take into account Patti Smith's tremendous sense of humor. Often the ""source"" being cited is a pr interview Smith gives as a book is being published or a record released. She says something really funny and facetious(probably to keep herself amused with inane questions). But the author doesn't get the joke and cites what Smith says as if it were some declaration of serious intent from on high, later contradicted by a different answer years down the road.Finally, it takes balls for the author to imply Smith is pretentious while his own book jacket declares himself to be the ""Poet Laureate of the New York Underground.""

85,Amazon,,"This book is nothing but a self-congratulatory epistle for India written by a man with modest writing and intellectual skills.  His constant use of terms like ""massive"" and ""huge"" when describing increases in business volumes, his complete lack of significant or comparative statistics and his untamed proclivity for hyperbole leaves the reader both bored and breathless.  The tale brings to mind the threats, twenty years ago, that Japan would ""buy the United States and rent it back to us.""  That ""miracle economy"" has been in uninterrupted recession since at least 1990.This author bases his arguments on ""because I say so"" reasoning extrapolated from his being Indian himself and any notion that there might just be a little bias in his thinking is squashed by his playing of the Race Card early in the book.  Then, after selecting quotes only from sources supporting his outrageous claims, he feels free to prognosticate about India's future without the need for any verifiable facts to support his thesis.Most entertaining was his claim that India will emerge as a military power.  India has not put a credible army in the field for a couple thousand years.  Since independence, they have either lost every conflict in which they were a participant (like against China) or fought to a bloody stalemate (like Pakistan).  Perhaps the author longs for the days of the Bengal Lancers but modern conflicts do not typically involve bayonet charges or mounted cavalry actions.This book has interesting ideas for serious study but it would be foolish to consider this the last word on the future of India as an economic force.  The author dismisses or ignores far too many important issues for that.  Example: what about the near nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan just a few years ago?  If such a confligration were to take place, in what kind of shape would that leave India's infrastructure and economic viability?  It is too real a possibility to be ignored but the author manages to do just that.  What about the AIDS epidemic rampaging through India and the rest of South Asia?  That disease has decimated a generation of leadership in Africa and it has just begun its grisly process in India?

88,Amazon,,"The 9/11 commission report should be found in the fiction section of your local book store.  The current US administration has no qualms about ""creating its own reality"" and this is the most perfect example of this practice.  It was crafted to ignore any and all evidence that contradicted their fabricated ""reality"" and then used the conclusions of this report to support the current foreign policy.  I urge you to do your own research and not blindly believe what this report tells you. Here are only a few of the many examples that prove that the 9/11 commission report lacks any credibility:1.  NORAD changed their story about their actions on 9/11 significantly at least three times.  The report (or NORAD) does not examine or give any explanation why this happened.  In any case it is standard NORAD procedure to intercept a jet anywhere in the US within 10 minutes of a possible aircraft problem and yet none were intercepted in the 80 minutes following the first confirmed hijacking.  The report does not examine why standard procedure was not followed. It also claims there were no NORAD flights until after the pentagon strike.  Why not?    2.  Several of the ""hijackers"" are still alive and have been interviewed by the BBC claiming that their passports were stolen, and the report makes no mention of this fact.3.  The book claims that the WTC towers had ""a hollow steel shaft, in which elevators and stairwells were grouped"".  This is outrageously false as the buildings had 47 massive steel central columns to support the building.4.  World Trade Center Building 7 completely collapsed at virtually free fall speed and yet this building is not even mentioned anywhere in the report.  This building was the third in history to completely collapse due to fire in history.  The other two were the WTC twin towers which also collapsed near the speed of gravity.  Straight-down collapse at free fall speed is scientifically impossible unless controlled demolition is employed.  The fundamental law of physics ""conservation of momentum"" proves this fact.    5.  The report blatantly ignored prolific eyewitness testimony of multiple explosions in the WTC towers.  This includes an explosion in the North Tower basement before it was struck by a plane.  This event was tape recorded in a nearby office meeting along with dozens of eye witness reports.  The testimony to this fact was simply ignored and left out of the report by the commission.  See also the firefighter tapes that were blocked from being released to the public for years by the government as well as news footage from the day in question.  In the entire report the word ""explosion"" is not encountered one single time.6.  The report also fails to mention that Marvin Bush (brother of the President), was in charge of security at not only the WTC complex, but Dulles international airport and United airlines.  The report fails to reveal who was involved in the massive insider trading just a few days before the attacks took place, only to claim that they had ""nothing to do with Al Qaeda"".  Philip Zelikow, the author of this report and executive director of the 9/11 commission is a member of the current administration, a close friend of Condoleezza Rice, and a co-author of the current terrorism policy ""Catastrophic Terrorism: Elements of a National Policy"".  Could there be a bigger conflict of interest here?  Need anything else be said?  In conclusion, it's not worth the paper it is printed on. Anyone who still takes this report seriously should read:Dr. David Ray Griffin - ""911 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions""Dr. Steven E. Jones - ""Why indeed did the World trade center buildings completely collapse?""Or watch these videos (currently available for free on Google video):""Improbable Collapse: The Demolition of our Republic""""9/11 Press for Truth""""911 Mysteries - Demolitions",long,3873,634,neutral,good,good,NORAD changed their story about their actions on 9/11 significantly at least three times .<q>It was crafted to ignore any and all evidence that contradicted their fabricated `` reality '' and then used the conclusions of this report to support the current foreign policy .<q>It also claims there were no NORAD flights until after the pentagon strike .,"The 9/11 commission report should be found in the fiction section of your local book store .

91,Amazon,,"Readers who are interested in finding out why the West has been targeted by some extremist Muslims as well as why so much anti-western sentiment exists in not only the Islamic world but the developing world at large (and more recently almost the entire world) would be better off reading the works of Edward Said - an Arab Christian who was a true scholar of Middle Eastern and European/American history and documented in several of his works many of the reasons the West is not held in high esteem - and with good reason as anyone would understand if they were on the receiving end (if you are not on the receiving end thank God or your lucky stars whatever works for you). Mark Gabriel's book is a sad story about a man who experienced persecution that should never have happened, however, it does nothing to help the reader understand the true roots of anti-western sentiment, or the violence perpetrated by a small number of Muslim extremists. I can understand his bitterness given his experiences. However, given his negative experiences and his rejection of Islam personally it is reasonable to infer (as the book demonstrates) that his views of Islam and its history are quite tainted. This book provides the reader with nothing but a very biased and stereotypical account of Islam and its history - IT WILL NOT HELP ANY WESTERNER UNDERSTAND THE REALITIES THAT EXIST IN THE MIDDLE EAST TODAY.By the way I believe you if you read Howard Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States"" you will see that there is no civiliation, Islamic, American, or otherwise that does not have violent blemishes in its past and present. However, these violent blemishes should not be used to characterize entire civiliations in their entirety which Gabriel's book unfortunately does.  If you want to truly understand the roots of violence perpetrated by a very small group of Muslims (remember there are 1 billion Muslims in the world and those committing acts of violence are drop in the bucket compared to the immense size of the total population - also let's not forget that plenty of violence has been perpetrated by some groups of Christians and Jews both in contemporary times and in the past) than read books by scholars who understand the pain and suffering of the Palestinians, the Iraqis, the Afghanis, and the ongoing humiliation, torture, and death, these people have suffered at the hands of the West, not to mention the humiliating history of European colonization and imperialism that has left its mark on the region. Also be reminded that the U.S.'s support of oppressive dictators in the region is not lost on the people who live and suffer under those oppressive regimes such as Bush's good friends the Saudi royal family. And of course Sadam Hussain, a current villian in the U.S., was once highly favored by the U.S. government who supplied him with arms and other types of aid during the eight year Iran-Iraq war. He lost his popularity with the U.S. government after he decided he no longer liked being a puppet. For a more accurate in-depth view of the history of the influence of the West on the East read Edward Said's foundational book ""Orientalism,"" ""the Question of Palestine,"" or Arhandati Roy's ""An Ordinary Persons Guide to Empire.""  Here you will read words and truths from scholars who come from colonized peoples, scholars who are/were not only great writers and scholars but who also write/wrote from a non-western perspective. If you want to understand the perspectives of Arabs and Muslims than reading books written by biased Westerners such as Gabriel is not the way to go.

The atlas also falsely claims that several Persian Gulf Islands belong to the newly created United Arab Emirates. It would appear that the National Geographic Society has joined hands with the enemies of Iran, and is now openly helping those who seek to compromise Iran's territorial integrity. Perhaps the National Geographic Society should look back on it's own maps to see that 33 years ago no entity by the name of United Arab Emirates existed, however Iran did. Furthermore, the National Geographic itself had previously always used the formal, and legitimate name, the Persian Gulf to reference the body of water in question.

I am very familar with analysts and how they work and have done some analyst work myself.  This book justifies to me why analyst are the most worthless people on wall street and how investment banking has ruined the true, real analysts similar to how Kessler described himself in the early years.Now to the stories.  Lets just say that analyst are no traders and shouldn't even be hanging out with them.  Kessler's ""wild"" tales sound more like a frat house than a Wall Street war room.  $4000 dinner?  Big deal.  Almost got into a fight?  Whew, that was a close one Andy.  What disturbes me the most is how he never talks numbers.  So and so did this deal and so and so got paid for this.  How much?

First of all Nick Leeson never traded bonds as you claim the man was a bond trader.  Secondly, the encounter took place in 1990 and even if he had been trading bonds, Leeson was not trading in Asia until the early to mid 90s.

99,Amazon,,"Robert Fried has designed a how-to book that articulates what passion in education is.  This topic has been lost in a black hole somewhere because  most often teachers are so busy that they do not have time to reflect on  what worked and what did not work in their lesson plans. 	The  Passionate Teacher demonstrates that we need to be more than just  passionate about our field of study - we need to build a ""stance"" about  students and learning.  Fried clearly illustrates that the quality of a  teacher's believing and behaving - what he calls ""stance"" - is what makes  passionate teaching possible.   Often times we find that the fear of  humiliation keeps students from sharing their most innovative,  controversial ideas, resulting in a lack of energy and enthusiasm in the  classroom.  Throughout this book, Fried offers real life personal stories  and ideas about how he and other teachers have put their passions to work.   After reading this book, one can picture the effects of passion in the  classroom.   	Fried reminds us that what we think is important for  students to learn in order to be successful in life, may not always be what  our students will feel they need.  He urges educators to build on knowledge  that students already have and to start bringing their interests into the  classroom. 	In the The Passionate Teacher, Fried explores the question,  ""Where do teachers hit the wall in their struggle to become or remain  enthusiastic about their profession?""  He offers strategies for getting out  of the ""game"" and onto something better.  To change the ""game"" teachers  need to start seriously listening to their students and find out what is  getting in the way of the kind of learning that they, like all of us, are  naturally supposed to seek out and respond to.    	Fried also stresses  the idea of having fun in the classroom.  Why wouldn't this make sense?   Most of a child's learning comes from play.  Teachers need to take a step  back and look at what they are doing - what they are teaching and ask  themselves what do they want their students to remember a year from now.   	 This is a book I am confident I will have by my side throughout my teaching  career. Fried's ideas are so inspiring. I have already begun implementing  his ideas and strategies into my planning.   I believe all teachers have  some element of passion for teaching, even though it may be lost.  Fried  teaches us how to put this passion to work and how to bring passion back  into our classrooms",long,2507,431,good,good,good,"Robert Fried has designed a how-to book that articulates what passion in education is .<q>Throughout this book , Fried offers real life personal stories and ideas about how he and other teachers have put their passions to work .<q>The Passionate Teacher demonstrates that we need to be more than just passionate about our field of study - we need to build a `` stance '' about students and learning .","Robert Fried has designed a how-to book that articulates what passion in education is .

100,Amazon,,"Arthur C Clarke is undoubtedly one of the seminal science fiction authors of the last century, and &quot;The City and the Stars&quot; was his finest work. To produce &quot;The City and the Stars&quot; Clarke endured a couple of decades of gestation before releasing the quintessential &quot;far  future&quot; novel. No one has done it better or as well since.In a few  pages TCAS encapsulated or spawned some many science fiction themes that it  has kept Clarke's imitators employed for generations. Unfortunately  &quot;Beyond the Fall of Night&quot; has one obvious observation, that,  given the vast amount of time that elapsed in the first novel life would  move on. Whilst true as an axiom, the underpinings of the second novel  utterly dimish the grandeur and depth of TCAS. TCAS was all about invoking  a sense of wonder at the future and a sense of melancholy at the decline in  our species. TCAS didn't rely on aliens, it was a book about us as a  species and about humanity making hard choices and living a productive  future with a vision. The simple beautiful language of the original is  spurned by the blunter prose of the sequel. Unfortunately as Arthur C ages,  his colloborative works become more evidently the product mostly of his  co-workers. Witness the &quot;Rama&quot; series, the first work, written  solely by Clarke, was superb yet the subsequent novels are derivative and  soul less swollen tomes produced mostly by Mr G Lee. The sure indicators of  a &quot;fake&quot; colloborative effort (ie where Clarke has little to do  with the actual writing) is the length of the work, the presence of sex or  religious overtones and a coy &quot;modernness&quot;. Most of science  fiction's writers when they reach their twilight years end up relentlessly  mining, and milking, their earlier inspirations - witness Asimov's and  Heinlein's essentially unproductive last twenty years but Clarke has shown  he continues to have his genius. &quot;How the World was Won&quot;,  &quot;The Ghost of the Grand Banks&quot; etc all show that Clarke remained  at the time &quot;Beyond&quot; was written a major creative force. Dr  Benford has had a collection of uneven novels behind him, although mostly  in his earlier works such as &quot;Artifact&quot; &quot;Across the Sea of  Suns&quot;, and &quot;If the Stars are Gods&quot;, before hitting his  stride in the excellent &quot;Great Sky River&quot; novels, so you would  expect something better.

101,Amazon,,"I was in the market for a new coffeemaker with a stainless steel thermal carafe. I read lots of online reviews and looked in person at the DeLonghi DCM485, the Krups FMF5 (both 10 cups), and the Cuisinart DTC-975 (12 cup). Each had mixed reviews. I ended up bringing home the DeLonghi and the Krups. Visually, there is no comparison.  The Krups looked like my grandma's Buick when parked next to the elegant Ferrari-like DeLonghi. But, would the DeLonghi brew good coffee? Would I have problems identified by other reviewers, like a badly-pouring carafe or spillover in brewing?Simply put, the DeLonghi lives up to its visual promise. It brews an extremely good cup of coffee.  If you read the manual and line up the ""fin"" on the lid to the correct pouring location, no seepage when pouring.   (I actually did it wrong before reading the manual; it was so drippy that I almost didn't keep it.) I've not had a problem with spillover during brewing, but to date have only brewed 6 cups max.Other fabulous features of the DeLonghi:  *The removable water tank, which can be taken directly to the tap for filling and *can be removed for cleaning*. The tank even fits nicely in the built-in water dispenser in the refrigerator door - coincidence, or just smart design? (I have not noticed any plastic-y taste, either.)*The removable filter basket - ditto for cleaning.  *The carafe has a wide mouth for easy, reach-in cleaning. (I have larger hands, and couldn't get my hand inside the Krups carafe.) The carafe keeps coffee at a decent drinking temperature for a good 6 hours. Not just-brewed hot, but decent - good performance for any thermal device, most of which, in my experience, lose a similar amount of heat over time. *The entire body exterior is stainless steel - very little cheesey black plastic to interfere with its appearance.  *Easy to program, easy to use, and the water level indicator works just fine.  On the downside, it's a tall critter, so measure your counter-to-cabinet clearance if you want to place it under your kitchen cabinets.This is a high-quality, well-designed machine, especially when compared side-by-side with the Krups, which just seemed flimsy in comparison - more plastic than stainless steel, a poorly-secured filter basket that seemed like it would fall off at the slightest bump, no removable water tank, a weird & less sturdy carafe lid, and seemingly less sturdy handle.If you're looking for this type of coffeemaker, I highly recommend buying the DeLonghi.  It's comparably priced in its class and offers powerful performance in an elegant package.  I couldn't be happier with it.

104,Amazon,,"This review is a little long-winded, but I am going to share with you my experiences after burning hundreds of DVDs.  After all, many of us are archiving data / video we will want to be able to access for decades into the future and currently there are no other reviews for this product on the site.I have used just about every type of recordable DVD media available and have concluded Fuji offers the best value.  I recommend you stick with the Fuji DVD-Rs made in Japan.  This is important since there are multiple manufacturers who make recordable DVDs for Fuji (not uncommon in the industry).  For the end user, the DVDs from the different manufacturers (all under the Fuji name) look nearly identical.  You might want to take the time to Google and then download a free utility program named DVD Identifier.  You simply put your recordable DVD into your computer's DVD writer and DVD Identifier will tell you who actually manufactured the DVD (many of you might be surprised the brand name on the disc and the actual manufacturer are often different).   For example, the Fuji DVDs made in Japan are made by Taiyo Yuden (one of - if not the most  - reputable manufacturers out there).  The Fuji DVDs made in Taiwan are made by an entirely different manufacturer.   Both the Japan and Taiwan Fuji DVDs look nearly identical in packaging and share a common proof of purchase code.  However, one set will note made in Japan under the proof of purchase code and the other set will note made in Taiwan under the proof of purchase code.  The other way to distinguish between the packages is the made in Japan DVDs will have the plastic spindle cover flush against the black spindle base.   The made in Taiwan DVDs will have the black base stick out slightly. I have heard some people say digital is digital and all DVDs are created equal.  This is not true.  You want to buy a DVD that is manufactured with quality.  You might save a few cents buying a cheaper DVD; however, you have to factor in bad burns and lost data.  With the cheapo DVDs, you will have more coasters and more DVDs that initially burn fine, but lose the data after a few months.  In the past two years, I have burned over 1,000 of the made in Japan Fuji DVDs and have only six bad burns and have not yet experienced lost data from any of the hundreds of successful recordings.      I use these Fuji DVDS more than any other brand.  I also use the Panasonic DVD-Rs (also manufactured by Taiyo Yuden) as well as unlabeled DVDs from an online wholesaler that are also manufactured by Taiyo Yuden.  The Fuji DVDs have an attractive silver color top, the Panasonics have an attractive gold color top.  The Panasonic DVDs are also much more expensive than the Fujis. In terms of compatibility, I have played the Fuji DVDs on over 20 different DVD players and have yet to find a player that does not play my video recorded on a Fuji DVD.The 50 pack Fuji spindle regularly goes on sale for $20 at a variety of retailers.

105,Amazon,,"This powerful documentary is a wonderful tribute to the four young girls whose lives were cut short in the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama on 15 September 1963.  First and foremost, it focuses on their lives, those who knew them, and the events going on in Birmingham while they were growing up.  It doesn't put the entire or primary focus on how they tragically were murdered, although naturally the bombing, the funerals, and the (rather belated) trials of the sick excuses for life who carried out the bombing are covered.  It's a celebration of life, not death.  (There are some brief graphic shots of the post-mortem photos, but as disturbing as these images might be, they carry home the impact of what really happened.)  It really is amazing that their friends, neighbors, and family members were able to retain such dignity and composure even when talking about such sad events and calling to mind people who had such short lives and who died in such an unnatural way.  While they'll be mourning for the rest of their lives, they haven't let the racist murderers destroy their lives.  They've bravely carried on as best they can.For many young people today, be they white or African-American, the events of the Civil Rights Movement are ancient history.  This documentary brings that struggle to life, using great archival footage and making clear how long these injustices had been going on, showing how the authorities let people get away with discrimination and often even cracked down on nonviolent protests themselves.  They would even turn on people who came to these events as observers, like one photographer who wanted to take pictures of the Freedom Riders getting off of the bus.  We're also treated to footage of an old and decrepit George Wallace claiming he wasn't a racist, that he's changed, that his best friend in the world, whom he's travelled all over with, is African-American.  (This guy, Ed, did not look or act like someone who were Wallace's best friend when he was coaxed on-camera; the footage of Wallace claiming he'd changed was pretty unconvincing and seemed as though he were patting himself on the back and rewriting history.)  It really makes the struggle these brave people went through seem real, significant, meaningful, not just something that happened in the distant past and which is no longer relevant.  It's hard to believe that these things were going on only a few decades ago.The opening and closing segments are very, very moving and powerful, and really give the viewer a sense of all that was lost that September day.  These were beautiful promising young girls who were loved by all and who loved everybody, and they were caught up in the middle of a racist society that hated and wanted to kill those who were different, murdered by people who were so filled with hate that they would even murder children.  They could have been doctors, lawyers, human rights advocates, teachers, writers, scientists, or just ordinary people who made a difference in their communities and who lived fine upstanding lives.

He introduced me to Asleep At The Wheel's first album &quot;Comin' Right At Ya&quot;. When that great Bob Wills song &quot;TAKE ME BACK TO TULSA&quot; started playing, this kid from Oklahoma was hooked! This was a great album of western swing that, up to that point, these ears had never heard. Asleep At The Wheel, who were originally from Austin, moved to San Francisco, and under the influence of Commander Cody, worked the clubs there and eventually became these great pioneering rockabilly/western swing revivalists. The Wheel were a talented band of great musicians. They had what were probably the two best fiddle players around in the legendary Johnny Gimble and the multi-talented Andy Stein from the Commander Cody Band, who claimed he could play virtually any stringed instrument you put in front of him. As for the music on their first record; besides &quot;TAKE ME BACK TO TULSA&quot;, two other tracks that really stand out on here are CHEROKEE BOOGIE, which features some great piano playing by Floyd Domino, and my favorite alltime Wheel song I'VE BEEN EVERYWHERE. You just gotta hear this one. It starts out ultra-slow and eventually turns into western swing on speed. It's great, and it's one I guarantee you'll be wanting to learn the words to. You'll be singin' it for days, or in my case years. As for the second album on this CD called &quot;Texas Gold&quot;. I believe this is their third record. It's not as good as their first two albums, but it's still a pretty good effort. The standout tracks on this one are &quot;THE LETTER THAT JOHNNY WALKER READ, which was cowritten by Commander Cody. &quot;ROLL EM FLOYD, which again features some great piano playing by Floyd Domino. Another song which I think is the best on the album is &quot;RUNNIN' AFTER FOOLS&quot;, which was written and sung by Leroy Preston, who besides this one, penned most of the songs on these two albums. This is a really nice twofer by the Wheel. Asleep At The Wheel's CD catalogue is not complete however, until Epic Records rereleases their self-titled second album, which has been mysteriously deleted. This was the Wheel's best record.

116,Amazon,,"Based on the Alan Hollinghurst novel, the BBC television series ""The Line Of Beauty"" unfolds through the eyes of Nick Guest (Dan Stevens). Nick, a middle class student studying Henry James at Oxford, is invited by his friend Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) to stay at his family's posh home in London's Notting Hill. Nick is swept away by the Feddens' prestige and affluence, and as he becomes enamored with the family, he's seduced by money, power, and sex into the moral void that surrounds the Feddens. Ultimately this is a tale of the 80--Thatcher's Britain, the corruption of the wealthy set, racism, homophobia, classism, and the sceptre of AIDS.Gradually Nick is absorbed into the Fedden home and becomes a permanent fixture. Although the Feddens on the surface appear to be a glamourous family, their elegant lifestyle, antique stuffed home, and perfect manners shield a great deal of ugliness. While Nick is ostensibly treated as 'one of the family,' there's always an implication that he has a social role to play. As a personable, unattached gay male, he makes up the difference at dinner parties by escorting single women, and he's also expected to be a caretaker of hostile lithium-plied daughter, Cat (Hayley Atwell). Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny) is a prominent Tory M.P. who's slated for a glittering career in the party. Pompous, hard, and ambitious, he hides these traits with a blustery joviality and a true talent to diffuse even the most explosive situation. Mrs. Fedden, Rachel (Alice Krige) is the perfect politician's wife--elegant, poised, but also content to stay in the background, and if there's anything ugly in her life, she copes by ignoring it.While everyone knows Nick is gay, it's a subject that's largely ignored and never discussed. Nick has a relationship with a lower class, bicycle riding black man, Leo (Don Gilet), and also with Wani Ouradi (Alex Wyndam), the Lebanese heir to a gigantic fortune. Wani, like most of the gay men in the Fedden's filthy rich set, is firmly in the closet, and he accepts the fact that he leads a risky double life. With Wani's money and influence, Nick establishes a glossy magazine and even toys with a film script for ""The Spoils of Poynton.""Nick is an amazingly hollow character, and it's no accident that he's a Henry James scholar. Nick, as the outside observer of the wealthy set, is the perfect Jamesian character. As a hanger on of the smug, self-satisfied filthy rich, he's half in love with the power and affluence of the upper crust, and he's also an observer of their troubling, tainted and poisoned morality. One of James's themes is that love is often in competition with power and aesthetic beauty. In ""The Line of Beauty"" power is the overriding element in all relationships, and this is something Nick--a class outsider--fails to realize until the very end. Directed by Saul Dibb, with a spectacular cast, stellar acting, and marvelous sets, ""The Line of Beauty"" exceeded my expectations. While on one level, it explores Nick's moral dilemma as he navigates life with the decadent, rich and powerful set, on another level, the plot is heavily influenced by the master, Henry James. It was delightful for this James fan to drink in the themes and the moral dilemma of Nick--a man who basically knows he should make a moral stand but subsumes his morality to the affluence and power of those who use him--and in some cases--even despise him--displacedhuma",long,3438,577,neutral,good,suboptimal,"Nick , a middle class student studying Henry James at Oxford , is invited by his friend Toby Fedden ( Oliver Coleman ) to stay at his family 's posh home in London 's Notting Hill .<q>Based on the Alan Hollinghurst novel , the BBC television series `` The Line Of Beauty '' unfolds through the eyes of Nick Guest ( Dan Stevens ) .<q>Nick is swept away by the Feddens ' prestige and affluence , and as he becomes enamored with the family , he 's seduced by money , power , and sex into the moral void that surrounds the Feddens .","Based on the Alan Hollinghurst novel , the BBC television series `` The Line Of Beauty '' unfolds through the eyes of Nick Guest -LRB- Dan Stevens -RRB- .

124,Amazon,,"Gustav Mahler was a great Viennese symphonist and conductor of the late Romantic period.  He said that this work was especially personal for him.  It was written during one of the most trying years of his life in 1907.  He resigned under pressure from the directorship of the Vienna Opera, which he had held for ten years.  His youngest daughter also became ill and died.  This was a severe blow for him (he was later buried next to her).  And his life long heart condition took a turn for the worse.  He would die in 1911 just short of his fifty-first birthday.One of his friends gave him a popular book ""The Chinese Flute"".  It was a German translation of ancient Chinese poetry (not completely accurate it turns out) and some of them struck Mahler as especially appropriate for his life.  He set seven of them in this symphonic song cycle (some call this a symphony even though Mahler later wrote a ninth symphony - there is good evidence that Mahler was quite superstitious about the ninth symphony jinx and in fact it was his last completed work.  This is a large work for a tenor and mezzo-soprano (or alto).  He also approved a version for tenor and baritone that is sometimes performed when a particularly wonderful baritone is available.  I quite enjoy the version as performed here with the mezzo.  The piece is in six movements with two poems and some words of Mahler being used to form the sixth movement.  The work is a little more than an hour with the last movement taking almost half of that time.It is interesting how Mahler uses the resources of such a large orchestra in small ensembles to support the singer and the poem.  The colors are quite varied between the movements and though it is a European symphonic orchestra, it definitely has elements that Westerners would call Chinese.  The mood of the movements varies quite broadly.  The last movement ""The farewell"" is wonderfully complex with resignation, longing, and ending with an eternal optimism.  This recording is very fine and when you realize it was recorded over a period of twenty-nine months with two different formulations of the Philharmonia and New Philharmonia orchestra (internal pique) and that the two soloists were never together during the recording (although they had performed the work with Klemperer in 1961), it is a near miraculous achievement and a testimony to Klemperer above all.  The tenor, Fritz Wunderlich, has a gorgeous voice that is big enough to sing with such a large ensemble, but lyric enough to make the songs sound like the lieder they are rather than a Wangerian epic.  Unfortunately, he died the year the recording was complete.  Christa Ludwig has most of the work, because the last movement is for the soprano.  She has a wonderfully rich voice with lots of substance and beauty.  She sings her songs here with wonderfully appropriate emotion and keeps the line going throughout.  One never feels the splices that are all to present in too many recordings.Mahler has his devoted following and he deserves to have them.  His stature never diminishes and you owe it to yourself to treat yourself to this work and this recording.  I am not as much a fan of Mahler as many of my friends, but I do love his work and amazed at his ability to pull off so many wonderfully colorful musical effects that add to the poetry being sung rather than overwhelming it.Highly recommended",long,3389,584,neutral,bad,bad,Gustav Mahler was a great Viennese symphonist and conductor of the late Romantic period .<q>The piece is in six movements with two poems and some words of Mahler being used to form the sixth movement .<q>This is a large work for a tenor and mezzo-soprano ( or alto ) .,"It was written during one of the most trying years of his life in 1907 .

129,Amazon,,"A longtime fan of Al Pacino, I saw ""Carlito's Way"" when it first came out, in 1993. Even back then, it was apparent to me that I was watching something very special. Since then, I've literally seen the movie hundreds of times, and it remains one of my all-time favorite films.The plot summary has been covered many times here, so I'll just stick to my comments. I think ""Carlito's Way"" is Brian DePalma's finest hour as a filmmaker. I could never understand the lukewarm critical response it received, though, ironically, time has been very kind to it. A lot of critics dismissed it as a second-rate follow-up to ""Scarface""--which, interestingly, was also panned upon its release--but it possesses a depth and resonance that ""Scarface"" (or any of DePalma's other films, for that matter) just can't match.Having grown up in Queens, New York, in the 1970s--and having run with a pretty tough crowd--I was stunned at how well DePalma captured the sights and sounds of the time. It was like being transported back 20 years. But, perhaps because the film was made two decades after it's supposed to take place, ""Carlito's Way"" hasn't aged at all. Like many great films, it has a timeless feel to it, because it avoids many of the filmmaking clichés of the period in which it was made.DePalma was already working from a very good foundation--Edwin Torres' two books on Carlito Brigante, ""Carlito's Way"" and ""After Hours,"" are exceptionally well written--but he could've easily dropped the ball. Thankfully, he didn't. Though he and Pacino were both initially opposed to rehashing the success of ""Scarface,"" they eventually decided to work together again. The combination was pure magic. Like many great actors, Pacino sometimes needs to be challenged, and DePalma challenged him. And he responded with one of the best performances of his legendary career. He brings an elegiac air to the character of reformed drug kingpin Carlito Brigante, which brings out a level of depth and emotional weight that the character of Tony Montana just didn't have. In fact, Carlito makes Tony seem woefully cartoonish and two-dimensional by comparison. As the film progresses, the psychic weight of Carlito's worsening dilemma is channeled perfectly by Pacino's every move and word. Despite Carlito's sordid past, you sympathize with him and his increasingly futile attempt to escape that past. The rapidly shrinking box that is Carlito's way out is communicated stunningly, by Pacino's acting, the excellent dialogue and cinematography, and, crucially, the music, which builds to a crescendo during the subway chase scene--one of the best chase scenes ever committed to film, in my opinion.A movie is nothing without fine acting, and DePalma did a wonderful job of casting ""Carlito's Way."" The cast is, to a person, first-rate: John Leguizamo as up-and-coming gangster Benny Blanco; Penelope Ann Miller as Carlito's love interest, Gail; Luis Guzman as the traitorous Pachanga; and the ringer, Sean Penn, as Carlito's sleazy, out-of-control lawyer, David Kleinfeld.  Penn has had a lot of great roles in his career, but his turn as Kleinfeld is definitely one of his most memorable: over-the-top, but never less than eminently believable . . . and chillingly frightening.As I said earlier, the years have been very kind to ""Carlito's Way."" It has aged better than any of DePalma's other films, and still looks and sounds as vital today as it did upon its release. That's a tough trick to pull off, but it's a testament to DePalma's filmmaking prowess and the actors' collective skill that, never once, do you catch yourself thinking about the age of the film. It's, quite simply, timeless--and, in this viewer's opinion, one of the best gangster films ever made. Whether history will judge it as such is debatable, but I believe that time will continue to enhance its reputation. It's a stunning cinematic achievement that will gain more and more supporters as the years go buy. I have absolutely no doubt about that.

Simple enough to avoid the toddler age frustrations of getting the cars to run on the track yet complex enough to engage a wide range of ages (up to and including Grandpas).  All the stories help with the imagination part....the books & videos provide an endless source of adventures that can be acted out, although most kids are perfectly capable of inventing their own episodes.Here is my advice, if you are trying to work your way through the maze of start-up options:First of all, you can spend a fortune on a huge set....even if you can afford it, I would start with something small and give the child the joy of receiving a chain of small but intriguing presents over a long period of time.  It fosters the joy of giving/receiving and helps teach them to come back again and again to the same toy...watching it grow, asking for specific items from the stories they hear, etc.  Several reviewers suggest painting an old coffee table and this is a great idea.I suggest the Figure 8 set (the most popular one) or if you want to spend a little bit more, the Conductors Figure 8 set.  Both are complex enough to be interesting, but simple enough to give lots of room for growth.  Almost immediately I would add a new present of one of the inexpensive engines (you can ask the child which story they like best and get that engine for them....or buy the engine to go with the video or book in the same gift)....these would be Percy The Small Engine, Bill The Yellow Engine, Treavor, (or a bit more $ for:) The Lady Engine, James The Red Engine, Gordon The Express Engine (he's one of the best stories, I think), or Henry The Green Engine.Now for the good stuff!  Give it a month or so, and then reward the child with something really cool like the Barrel Loader or Rusty the Construction 3 Car Set.I honestly can't see the point in the huge multi hundred dollar system sets.  If you want to impress the neighbors or something, go for it, but I'm telling you.....most kids will enjoy a large number of small thoughtful gifts, not a ""keep-up-with-the-Jones"" effort on your part.Good behavior can be rewarded with a pick-your-own trip to the store (there are sometimes when a real time shopping trip can't be beat)By the way, the Thomas stories are based on real restored engines that run in England on the Mid-Hants Railway Watercress line near Winchester (you can read about them an even plan a trip to ride on the real Thomas trains by checking out  watercressline.co.uk).  They are a day trip from the London rail stations, although I recommend using a B&B in the Winchester area and staying overnight if you decide to go.

I'm not even sure if it was nominated for Best Picture, but I have to say...This movie was better than ""Rocky"" OK. The movie won four Academy Awards;The one I mentioned above, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Sound. It's also rated PG, which is strange because they use the word f**k at least 8 times  in this movie and nowadays, two uses can get you slapped with an R rating. But the movie opens as we witness four men breaking into the Watergate Building, which we all know was the setting for Democratic National Headquarters. The police show up and catch the men in the act of setting up survelliance/bugging the place and the story shows upBob Woodward's (Redford) desk. Woodward is a reporter at The Washington Post who reports the story and then begins to see oddities about it. Why would men break into the Democratic National Headquarters? Who sent them? Etc. Eventually joining in the act of helping him is Carl Bernstein (Hoffman) who begin a thorough investigation of the scandal that begins to turrn up names very high up in government and eventually even The President of the United States, Richard Nixon. Bernstein and Woodward worked their a$$es off to get this story, through apparent death threats and when people wouldn't talk to them, and they got it all right. Robards plays their boss, Ben Bradlee and deserved his Oscar. Another performance that was really good, although his face is almost entirely hidden in shadow is Hal Holbrook as the mysterious Deep Throat. Deep Throat was one of Woodward's informants who apparently worked high up in the government and seemed to know everything about the Watergate cover-up. Except he refused to just give up and information, only hints and could never be directly quoted or even referred to. Woodward, to this day has not given up the identity of Deep Throat or even gave the vaguest idea of who he might've been. Anyway, for a movie about reporters trying to unravel a cover-up, this movie was incredibly entertaining and exciting. It's never boring, it's never dull; both Hoffman & Redford play their parts extraordinarily well, which causes us to like the movie even more. And it's strange too, the movie doesn't end with Nixon resigning; but instead ends with Nixon taking his 2nd Oath of Office.

141,Amazon,,"Having recently turned 34, I decided to go back to college.  These last few weeks have brought back memories such as standing in long lines, worrying about financial aid, exorbitant book store prices, finding my way around campus, entrance exams (which can be quite challenging if your math is rusty like mine), and trying to find classes that best suit my work schedule.  All of this has to happen before the first minute is actually spent in class.  Being an older than average college student prompted me to write a review on this comedy classic about a college freshman much older than myself.The sorely missed Rodney Dangerfield plays Thornton Melon in perhaps his greatest performance ever.  Melon is a wealthy self-made sixty year-old entreprenuer whose massive retail chain specializes in clothes for large men.  What Melon lacks in formal education, he makes up for by being hard-working and having a solid business know-how that is not taught in the economics classes.  Two things happen that bring his life to a crossroads.  First of all, he catches his no-good wife (played with perfect bitchiness by Adrianne Barbeau) making time and a half with another man.  Secondly, his awkward, unhappy son Jason (played by Keith Gordon) calls him to say he wants to drop out of college.  So, what's a rich over the hill fatcat to do?  Enroll at his son's college, what else?Thornton initially has a good thing going at school with partying, cutting up in class, and lots of beautiful female students.  His wealth and fun-loving personality make him a hit with most of the other students.  He doesn't just throw parties; he IS the party.  His popularity even begins to rub off on Jason - which is a mixed blessing since he wants to succeed at school on his own merits.  But soon his partying and the fact that he has paid consultants to do his homework  illegally begin to catch up with him.As I mentioned earlier in the review, Rodney was at the top of his game here.  He was cleary having a good time making the movie, and that good time works its way to the viewer.  The supporting cast is also excellent.  Paxton Whitehead is perfect as an aloof Economics professor who serves as Thornton's diametrically opposed antagonist.  Robert Downey Jr, an actor who normally annoys me to end, is hilarious as Jason's punked-out diver-heckling best friend.  The late Sam Kinison is especially memorable as a psychotic History professor/Vietnam veteran.  You even have a cameo by Kurt Vonnegut Jr (yes, the same Kurt Vonnegut Jr who wrote _Slaughterhouse Five_).  Back to School is a textbook (bad choice of words) example of how great comedy films used to be before the comedy genre became hijacked by disgustingly unfunny toilet humor mavens like Rob Schneider and bland rom-com chick flicks.Not only is Back to School great for those times when you just need a good belly laugh, it also has a great message about the importance of both having to work hard and also having a good time.  Thornton was having a hard time with college because he partied too much.  Jason, on the other hand, was unhappy because he worked too hard and didn't take time to smell the roses.  Both of them needed to find a balance. Everyone going to school (college, high school, etc.) should take that lesson to heart. I certainly intend to.

143,Amazon,,"Some time ago, it was reported that Natalie Dessay was facing a vocal crisis, and I became quite worried at how her voice would sound after that. Now I know I had no real reasons to be worried, since the superb Natalie Dessay proved again what a great and intelligent artist she is. While Natalie Dessay has had to abandone a little her former lirico-leggero coloratura singing with an abundance of stratospheric high notes and superhuman agility, she has now gained an equally stupendous voice. It's now creamier and fuller than before, with a much improved low register and a richer middle register. She doesn't attempt the highest notes anymore (notice that highest notes for Dessay mean High G's and High A's, since she's still able to hit a wonderful High E Flat or High E), but her artistry seems to have deepend and matured. One of my greatest praises to her singing has always been Dessay's ability to convey the proper nuance and dramaticism to any melody she sings, even if it's a simple recitative. Now she seems to have reached the complete maturity of her artistry, and this album is a proof of that.This is an album of Händel's Italian Cantatas, which are full of nuanced and fascinating music. They may not have the dramaticism of his later operas nor the depth of other sacred pieces by him, like Messiah, but they have that wonderful melodical creativity that Händel had. In ""Un pensiero voli in ciel"", Dessay shows her flowing legato in long coloratura lines with the accompaniment of lively, meaningful strings. The aria ""Lascia omai le brune vele"" contains some fascinating, unselfconsciously exuberant fioriture, which are sung by Dessay with stunning ease. She's also magnificent in the more lyrical and melancholic arias, such as ""Per te lasciai la luce"" or ""Ho tanti affanni in petto"", where it's amazing to hear the rich and expressive vocal colours and tones of Dessay's voice.There are some people who criticize Emanuelle Haïm's always lively and exciting conducting. Those must be real purists, who prefer a flawless sound to an orchestral performance that shows all the dramatic and melodical nuances of the music. As I'm not a Baroque purist, I must say I'm a real fan of Haïm's conducting. She doesn't seem to care a lot about creating a perfectly homogeneous and transcendental sound, but rather creating a sound that excites the ears and is meaningful to the heart, and she always succeeds. In this way, her conducting is a perfect accompaniment to Natalie Dessay, whose superb voice is always used to favor the drama that imbues the music.Definitely, this is one of the best Händel releases of the last years, and it's also a great success for Dessay, who digs new repertoire for her and proves to be ideal for it. I highly recommend this excellent album",long,2788,476,neutral,neutral,good,"While Natalie Dessay has had to abandone a little her former lirico-leggero coloratura singing with an abundance of stratospheric high notes and superhuman agility , she has now gained an equally stupendous voice .<q>Now she seems to have reached the complete maturity of her artistry , and this album is a proof of that.This is an album of Händel 's Italian Cantatas , which are full of nuanced and fascinating music .<q>One of my greatest praises to her singing has always been Dessay 's ability to convey the proper nuance and dramaticism to any melody she sings , even if it 's a simple recitative .","Now I know I had no real reasons to be worried , since the superb Natalie Dessay proved again what a great and intelligent artist she is .

144,Amazon,,"A great album from a great band similar to Van Halen and Dokken. Vito Bratta is up there with the best guitarists of the 80's... Randy Rhoads, George Lynch, Yngwie Malmsteen, Eddie Van Halen, Jake E. Lee, Warren DeMartini, Tony MacAlpine and so on.1.Lights and Thunder- 10/10 A great intro with Vito making his guitar scream with some great harmonics, dives and some shredding with some cool backround music. A great mix of heavy and soft music with some cool vocals from Mike Tramp. A good solo from Vito too. Very good lyrics too. This song probably lasts too long but hell if you think it's lasting to long than change it to the next song ;)2.Broken Heart- 10/10 A great acoustic intro that leads into a great melodic song with an awesome riff and guitar tone. Some cheesy lyrics but this is a great song with an awesome solo.3.Leave Me Alone- 10/10 A great heavy riff. Some great vocals too. Vito's solo is great too as he shreds away and his vibrato is amazing as well. This solo sounds like a mix of Zakk Wylde, George Lynch, Jake E. Lee with a little Yngwie thrown in.4.Love Don't Come Easy- 7.5/10 A good song although I think Mike Tramp's voice is too soft for the song although Vito's solo is excellent again as the ending line of the solo is amazing.5.You're All I Need- 8/10 A good ballad although Tramp's vocals are too soft. Vito continues to turn in a great performance on the guitar as his solo is filled with emotion.6.It's Over- 9/10 A great soft song with another tremendous solo from Vito Bratta.7.Warsong- 10/10 An excellent heavy riff with harder vocals from Mike Tramp. Some good lyrics actually. Some amazing shredding by Vito who blazes on the guitar8.She's Got Everything- 10/10 A great heavy riff and this song seems Badlands influenced although Mike Tramp doesn't hit the high notes Gillen hits in every Badlands song. Vito's solos are great as he shreds and adds a wah wah pedal into these solos. The acoustic solo at the end is incredible too!9.Till Death Do Us Part- 8/10 A sappy ballad. Not the best track on here. And nothing special about this one execpt Vito's great solo which is filled with emotion.10.Out With the Boys- 10/10 Another good heavy riff. This is a great fast paced song. A great melodic party type song. Vito tears up the solo with some great arpeggios and tremelo picking.11.Blue Monday- 8/10 A good slow blues instrumental. Vito's playing is excellent once again although this is song is too slow.12.Farewell to You- 1/10 BY FAR the worst track on the album this is a soft song that doesn't do anything and the ""na na na na na"" is RIDICULOUS I mean I like the band but this song isn't very goodThis album is very good and I suggest you get it.

146,Amazon,,"To some, bugged-out is an insult. To Kool Keith, it's a lifestyle. While other emcees talk about how insane they are, and use it merely as a gimmick, Keith has time spent in an asylum as proof of his authenticity. Is spending time in a padded-room neccessarily something to take pride in? Absolutely not. But for Kool Keith, it's something that has greatly set him apart from his contemporaries.There isn't a moment on this album that Keith, under his Dr. Octagon alias, is even close to being sane; the stuff he spits is so outrageous, and so absurd, that even if you lived your life as a continuous acid trip, this album would still fly over your head like the UFOs Keith's so obsessed with. When he does the chorus to ""Earth's People,"" spitting ""Earth's people, New York and California, earth's people, I was born on Jupiter,"" he'll literally leave you scratching your temple for days on end, pondering what the heck he just said. Yet he's so dope on the microphone, it doesn't matter. Track after track, he comes correct with tight, albeit off-beat flows, with intricate rhymes about the most random of things. On No Awareness, he opens the song with ""Your organic medical talk propels off my arms, the atom bomb final Lionel Richie not couth for this battle. I battle sing-sing-sing like bing-bing-bing,"" and understanding that is next to impossible. Sometimes Keith doesn't even bother to rhyme, yet his flow will have you thinking otherwise, as he never loses it throughout this release.The production is absolutely phenomenal. Dan The Automator is clearly one of the best behind the boards, and doesn't get the proper credit he deserves in most hip-hop circles. The production is eery, and the science-fiction influences are heavy; much like Keith's rhymes themselves. There is not a single bad piece of music on this album, from either the emcee or his producer; creating a masterpiece which, unfortunately for Keith, greatly overshadows his enormous catalogue.While Keith may've disowned the Dr. Octagon alias due to this album's success, and not attracting the audience he'd wanted, that doesn't change the fact that this as original an album as you'll find in any form of music.

147,Amazon,,"First off, the reviewer before me just doesnt understand music. Iron Butterfly ALWAYS changed album to album.Heavy sounded like pop/rock with a splash of psychedelia. More Beatles influenced than anything else.Vida is a psychadelic classic. The whole flower power thing is in full effect.Ball was a little rock, a little psychadelic. Some flower power but not as many ""Feel Good, Love EVERYONE"" type of songs on this one. Some songs were downright scary.Therefore, there is no reason to believe they'd stay the same band with the addition of 2 new guitarists. Both ""El Rhino"" Larry Reinhardt and Mike Pinera had their own style, but for some reason they compliment each other nicely. Over the course of the 9 songs you get almost that many song styles. Here is a breakdown of the songs:Free Flight: This brief instrumental (40 seconds) is a part of the last track Butterfly Bleu. Not sure why they felt they needed to do this but it is a nice cut.New Day: This was a single in a few foreign countries. Good guitar riff, great vocals. Good rock song.Shady Lady: This is their attempt at funk apparently. Sounds kinda porn-ish in a way. But the guitar solo is good. Some interesting lyrics, most arent very understandable.Best Years Of Our Lives: Great GREAT song!. Mike Pinera sings most of it Great riffs and solos. Great topic of song. Should have been a single. This is proof of how AWESOME of a guitarist that Mike Pinera is. This, easy rider, butterfly bleu and the song from his other band (Ride Captain ride) is the only proof you need.Slower Than Guns: An acoustic song. Only has Doug Ingle and Ron Bushy performing on it. The other 3 didnt like the song so they opted to not participate (according to Ingle, Pinera says they recorded it when he wasnt around) Good song, about how man is ruining the earth. well sung!Stone Believer: A single in most countries. Good song. More good riffs. A good song because of the dual lead vocals by Mike & Doug. More great soloing. Kinda spiritual in its lyrics. Soldier in our town: Easily the weakest track on the album. This one is another with only Ron Bushy & Doug Ingle. (Additional instrumentation for the 2 songs was played by the producer and engineer) Doug Ingle screeches the choruses in this one. Another sad note. This was the flipside of both New Day and Easy Rider. Wastes your 45 with an awful song.Easy Rider: Not a song used in the movie (it came after the movie) but about Motorcycles. Great drums, and guitar. More shared vocals. Shame it is only 3 minutes long. But it cooks like no other song from 1970.Butterfly Bleu: This 14 minute epic is a blues number. Sadly no drum solo but the song is PHENOMINAL otherwise. Some great jamming on the song. IMPORTANT HISTORICAL NOTE: This song is the first appearance EVER of a talk box effect on the guitar. No Peter Frampton, Joe Walsh and Richie Sambora did not innovate its usage. You wouldnt believe the amount of people who think it started with Do You feel Like We Do, Rocky Mountain Way & Living On A Prayer. It is in it's infancy, so it sounds like someone is throwing up on the microphone. Overall, the album is a 9 out of 10. The only setback is Soldier in our Town. If Silly Sally had been included instead (non album flipside to Stone Believer) then it would have made the album a perfect 10.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",long,3329,594,good,good,good,"Iron Butterfly ALWAYS changed album to album.Heavy sounded like pop/rock with a splash of psychedelia .<q>Both `` El Rhino '' Larry Reinhardt and Mike Pinera had their own style , but for some reason they compliment each other nicely .<q>This , easy rider , butterfly bleu and the song from his other band ( Ride Captain ride ) is the only proof you need.Slower Than Guns : An acoustic song .","Iron Butterfly ALWAYS changed album to album.Heavy sounded like pop/rock with a splash of psychedelia .

It was a no-brainer for me to buy the soundtrack but I was surprised by how much I would enjoy it. Usually TV show soundtracks have half the songs that you actually like, and the other half are songs you can't even remember being on the show and seem like filler. This CD is unique in that it is one of the only CDs I own where I like EVERY single track. It's amazing.Track 1: We Used to Be FriendsProbably my least favorite on the album only because I've heard it so many times. It's still catchy and a great song, though.Track 2: I Hear the BellsFantastic song by Mike Doughty. The lyrics are interesting and the melody is addictive. It reminds you of when it appeared in the show and makes you think of Logan and Veronica back in the day.Track 3: I Know I Know I KnowOne of the main reasons for me wanting this soundtrack. I remember hearing it in the episode when it originally aired. It's insanely catchy and a great song to listen to in any mood.Track 4: I Turn My Camera OnPerfect song to emulate Veronica's job as an amateur sleuth. It has an atmospheric, funk pop feel that is extremely enjoyable.Track 5: No Sleep TonightSong with a great beat. A great song to listen to if you want to get in a good mood.Track 6: DakotaMy favorite track of the album. A mellow and amazing song that evokes times past. It sort of reminds you of the past. Track 7: SwayGreat love song. I wasn't too keen on it at first, but it grew on me.Track 8: Long Time ComingAnother highlight of the album.

A somber and inspiring track.Track 10: Ocean City GirlDidn't like this song at first, but the mood it puts you in is very relaxing. Great song to just chill to.Track 11: Momentary ThingScreams of Veronica and Logan. Great song to bring up memories.Track 12: The Way You AreOne of the most unique songs on the album. It's dark tones are absolutely addicting and thrilling to listen to.Track 13: Lost & FoundA nice, sweet song that perfectly captures some teen angst.Track 14: Lily Dreams OnI couldn't think of a better end to end the soundtrack. Words cannot express how beautiful this song is. It also ended the first season with a dreamy feel.

152,Amazon,,"This DVD was expensive and disappointing.  I cannot recommend this for anyone who wants to use a DVD as a learning tool for makeup instruction.  It's not even good entertainment for those of us who consider the makeup-and/or-hair-styling-instructional-DVD genre as the epitome in chick flick decadence. The featured makeup artist, Ramy, may be talented - it's hard to tell based on this effort. The DVD comes across as nothing more than an extended infomercial promoting one artist, his New York salon, and his line of Beauty Therapy cosmetics.  And not a very tempting infomercial, either.There appear to be lots of products and colors visible behind Ramy's station as he works on the models.  However, he seems to use the same one or two products and colors on all of his subjects. That wouldn't be a problem if the featured colors were so neutral that they did the job for all the girls, but they don't.  Even though the majority of the models apparently fall into the warm-with-golden-undertones category, the two favored foundation colors (Porcelain Doll and Almond Princess) were obviously too yellow for most of them.  The fact that he used these colors almost exclusively leads one to conclude that the make up line is limited and leans toward warm tones, but not in a natural way.   The production values here weren't very good.  Although the DVD wasn't filmed in HD, it's simultaneously enlightening and ghastly to view this on an HDTV.  Not only is it disturbingly obvious that the products Ramy uses don't match the skin tones, they don't go on evenly.  Ramy continually stresses that his foundation is a liquipowder that goes on liquid but ""dries to a micronized powder"" - a very blotchy powder apparently.  The finished faces looked unnatural with patchy areas of uneven pigment around the mouth and  nose and obvious lines of demarcation.  Almost every one of the girls looked like a ""Glamour Don't"" after the make up was applied. Although his contouring work is pretty good, Ramy demonstrates by working on one side of the face and then turning the model's chair so we can see the difference between the two sides.  Unfortunately, while he's working, the camera is usually on the side of the model that isn't being worked on, so most of the time it's hard to tell what he actually did to get that effect.  If you're interested in picking up makeup tips and techniques, a much better choice would be the DVD, ""Your MakeUp - Simple Steps to Amazing Looks"".  That DVD, also available on Amazon, has higher quality video, more practical instruction, and greater diversity among the subjects.  It features a variety of male and female make up artists using generic make up and describing in detail everything they're doing and why. It is far more interesting and instructional than Ramy's extended sales pitch for his cosmetic line.",long,2843,480,good,good,good,"The DVD comes across as nothing more than an extended infomercial promoting one artist , his New York salon , and his line of Beauty Therapy cosmetics .<q>However , he seems to use the same one or two products and colors on all of his subjects .<q>Although the DVD was n't filmed in HD , it 's simultaneously enlightening and ghastly to view this on an HDTV .","I can not recommend this for anyone who wants to use a DVD as a learning tool for makeup instruction .

153,Amazon,,"This film is an absolute piece of garbage, but according to the Academy, this was the finest film of 1951.  I would rather watch Strangers on a Train, A Streetcar Named Desire, The African Queen, A Place in the Sun--I'd rather watch myself drive off a cliff.  Gershwin may have rhythm.  Gene Kelly definitely has rhythm when he dances.  But whoever threw this film together had no sense of cinematic rhythm.  Here's a basic rule of thumb:  when you're making a narrative film, don't take leave of the story--especially at the end--for a 17 minute (no joke) dance number that is only nominally related to the plot.  I don't care how good you might think Gene Kelly danced and choreographed that number.  You know Kurosawa directed a hell of a fight scene at the end of Seven Samurai.  Why don't we throw that in this movie too?  Because it would be stupid and make the film uneven, right?  That's right.  And that's exactly what this 17 minute dance number does to An American in Paris.  An unfair comparison?  Okay let's take the Karate Kid.  It's the end of the movie.  Daniel-san is hurt bad.  But instead of having Mr. Miyagi do that voodoo hand slap and rub combo to fix Daniel-san's leg, Daniel just stares in thought.  We now understand what we are seeing is what he is thinking about.  And what do we see?  Seventeen minutes of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai battle sequence.  Then when that's done, we fade back to Daniel-san staring at  nothing.  He stands up and his leg is fine and the karate tournament is over and he's won the thing!  You would think that movie was pretty stupid right?  That's essentially how the 17 minute Gene Kelly dance sequence feels.  Seventeen minutes of talent, to be sure, but what the devil is it doing the middle of the film?  No wait not the middle.  It's at the end.  It's replaced the climax of the film--and doing a poor job of it I might add.  Then it ends, Gene Kelly's daydream is over, and everything is okay.  The end.  Lame.  And don't try to tell me that the dance sequence was the climax--that it resolves the film if you interpret the symbolic dancing right.  Whatever.  A film with such an amateurish plot hasn't earned the right to suddenly become cerebral.  An American in Paris is like our Karate Kid with Kurosawa tacked onto it--a cheesy average film with a chunk of talent thrown in the mix without much rhyme or reason--or rhythm.  Would our Karate Kid-Seven Samurai hybrid deserve the Oscar for best picture?  Neither did An American in Paris.  Just because it's got Gene Kelly and some Gershwin tunes doesn't make it a great, or even a good, film.

160,Amazon,,"If a ""suspense"" filmed was played in the woods, and it didn't actually contain any suspense, would a bear watch it? The previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making ""Domestic Disturbance"", the newest `thriller' starring John Travolta, Vince Vaughn and Teri Polo. Let's talk for a few minutes about Mr. Travolta. Can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them? I think that Travolta has now surpassed Richard Dreyfuss as the comeback/ lose it again king. After a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer Quentin Tarantino in ""Pulp Fiction"", Travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices. ""Face/Off"" and ""Broken Arrow"" highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed Travolta to join the $20 million club. In the last few years, every film Travolta has appeared in has failed miserably. ""Lucky Numbers""? ""The General's Daughter""? That film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it? ""Swordfish""? Interesting, but a flop. ""Battlefield Earth""? Why does he keep making this trash? It has to be the paychecks. I can't see any other conceivable reason. John, baby, how long before the studios realize that these films aren't making any money and they stop hiring you? John, baby, how long before you need another comeback vehicle? Frank Morrison (John Travolta) is a divorced father who makes wooden boats. He doesn't get a lot of business, but the business that he does get gets a great deal. He doesn't charge his customers enough to make a profit. Frank does this because HE IS THE GOOD GUY. His son, Danny (Matthew O'Leary) has a lot of problems accepting his mom's (Teri Polo) new relationship with Rick Barnes (Vince Vaughn). He gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone. A couple of days after his mom and Rick get married, he stows away in Rick's car and witnesses him murdering a business associate. The police don't believe him however. After a little soul searching, Frank believes his son. He may lie to everyone, but he doesn't lie to Frank. Directed by Harold Becker (""Sea of Love""), ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a suspense film without any suspense. From the moment Danny stows away in Rick's car and WATCHES HIM MURDER Ray (Steve Buscemi), which we also watch, we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is. To make matters worse, Frank instantly believes his son, which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between Frank and Rick. A boring cat and mouse game. When you know the identity of the villain, a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet. When Frank believes Danny early on, the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it. The film would've been greatly improved by showing Danny in the backseat of the car, watching everything, the pain and suspense registering on his face, while the audience sees nothing. Then, when Danny tries to convince his dad, the police chief, his mom, that Rick is a murderer, at least we haven't seen the act, and we would require some convincing as well. Because the filmmakers chose to show us everything, the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have Frank doubt Danny, his son. However, after a very brief segment, Frank believes Danny, causing us to watch a battle between Frank and Rick, which isn't very interesting. Each of the actors, including Travolta, are serviceable in their roles, but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes, the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium. Skip ""Domestic Disturbance"". It isn't even worthy of a video rental. Go to see the far superior and very different ""Amelie"" or ""The Man Who Wasn't There"".

I play bass, I understand music, and Umphrey's is among my favorite bands (others include 311, Widespread Panic, Deep Banana Blackout, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soulive, Medeski Martin Wood).  In general I am open to all kinds of funky music, and Umphrey's usually puts out.  In my opinion, this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk (following the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 311).  With this album I was expecting them to develop their sound from Anchor Drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like RHCP's Blood Sex Sugar Magic did, while staying true to their unique roots in Jazz, blues, rock and even some metal.  Like I said, they fuse genres like no one else can...THIS album, however, was a complete failure in the areas I have described above.First off, I can understand how reviewers point to the production quality, and the musical talent displayed throughout the album.  Umphreys Mcgee is insanely talented, and no effort could hide that from the listener.  HOWEVER, to be blunt this album is boring as hell, has no funk or rock in it period, and is frankly somewhat depressing.  IF your expecting wild guitar improv, explosive beats and fun, uplifting music--ignore this album.  If you are a fan of Umphrey's live show and their past albums--ignore this album.  If you tend to be willing to overlook production quality in search of funkier, jazzier guitar rifs and bass experimentation--do not buy this album.  The only way I can summate this album is that its a typical indy type album.  Slow songs without enough music, little variance from song to song, depressing lyrics, and a slow pace.  Some say this is Umphreys showing their full range, I say this is them bottling up their range in a more mainstream package that is not all that enjoyable.The only reason I wrote this review is that Im amazed by the other reviews on this page.  I wish I had never heard this album, it is a pathetic effort from a band as experimental and fun as Umphreys Mcgee.  They missed a golden opportunity to come out with the next great funk compilation, this album is a step in the wrong direction. I strong advise the listener who likes to be entertained by music, rather than production quality and introspective lyrics, to steer way clear of this album.  This was a massive dissappointment beyond any album release I have ever heard (including By the Way from RHCP, which is an achievement in musical creativity compared to Safety in Numbers)",long,2679,469,good,suboptimal,neutral,"HOWEVER , to be blunt this album is boring as hell , has no funk or rock in it period , and is frankly somewhat depressing .<q>In my opinion , this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk ( following the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 311 ) .<q>With this album I was expecting them to develop their sound from Anchor Drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like RHCP 's Blood Sex Sugar Magic did , while staying true to their unique roots in Jazz , blues , rock and even some metal .","Trust me , I am not someone who claims to be a music expert , but I am a big fan of Jam/Funk and Jazz fusion .

164,Amazon,,"This album was one of the worst Journey albums ever. The songs heavily lean towards sappy soft rock with terrible lyrics. I personally loved Open Arms, Faithfully, and most of Journey's Greatest Hits but this album is definitely NOT up to par. Perhaps it has a lot to do with Perry's voice no longer being a smooth golden sounding tenor. Instead it's unbearably raspy and sounds like he's straining for every note. Too bad he didn't classically train his voice to preserve his sound. Or maybe it was the drugs n' alcohol that did him in. Whatever the case, his voice is very rough and unpleasant sounding on this album.  1. Message of Love - nice new-wave instrumental intro but lyrics sucked ""I walk alone in the dark without you ... in the shadows of love"" Terrible song, the catchy hook was horrid as well - ""Baby can you hear my message of love"" Could not get into this song at all.2. One More - there's a trend to the songs on this album, the intros are deceiving, the songs start off with a nice beat but once Perry sings the first few banal lyrics, you're instantly turned off. 3. When You Love a Woman - the only decent sounding song on this album. This Grammy-nominated tune has nice hooks and Perry's raspy voice is somewhat pleasant to listen to. Lyrically, it's nothing special to write home about it other than your cheesy love song.4. If He Should Break Your Heart - Again a nice soft rock start but then the chorus title is repeated so many times turns it into an unbearably lame tune.5. Forever in Blue - This song sucked from the beginning intro. As soon as I heard Perry sing ""When she walked into the room"" I thought oh god, not another lame love song. Recycling their lyric ""two hearts"" doesn't save this song from the rubbish bin.6. Castles Burning - Absolutely the worst song on the album. Perry sounding like Tina Turner with a painfully sounding strained voice. This song tries to be a rocker but ends up as pitiful noisy nonsense. 7. Don't Be Down on Me Baby - A failed attempt for a R&B song. Again the lyrics were terrible. 8. Still She Cries - Lovely guitar intro and nice ""We were good"" chorus. But the rest of lyrics didn't help the song stand out at all.9. Colors of the Spirit - An unremarkable song that is quickly forgotten.10. When I Think of You - By the 10th song on the album, I'm feeling like enough of the sappy love songs. Yet again, Journey or maybe Perry himself fails to make a memorable impact. Lukewarm lyrics and vocals.11. Easy to Fall - Another false start with a bluesy start but the song disintegrates into yet another bland love song.12. Can't Tame the Lion - Finally, a bit of a beat to wake me up from my coma after suffering through 11 tracks of soft rock. Sadly, the incredibly stupid lyrics - can't tame the lion just ruins whatever momentum the song started.13. It's Just the Rain - I'm happy by this song, not because it's a wonderful song, but because it's nearing the end album and I no longer have to suffer through it to write this review. This song fails yet again due to horrid lyrics and a nondescript melody.14. Trial by Fire - For a title song this song is not memorable at all. At this point, I don't feel like I can go on listening to this slow-moving tripe. So many talents in the band were wasted by poor songwriting and not a single hit song.15. Baby I'm a Leavin' You - Finally, I've reached the end of the album. It's nice to hear Journey try out a reggae beat on their songs but UB40 they definitely are not. Perry's vocals and lyrics somehow destroy whatever pleasant sound this song could have been.

166,Amazon,,"Flipping through the pages of Writer's Digest at a local bookstore, I found some of its content to be particularly useful and interesting, especially those on the trade of writing that could benefit the novice writer. So I decided to subscribe to the magazine and it was only then that I realise that problems do persist in this seemmingly wholesome and helpful magazine. Since I have subscribed online directly through WD's website in Jan 2005, I have received only a few issues. In the first few months for almost half a year, I received no issues at all. It was only later then when I e-mailed them did they manage to get some issues through to me. The annoying thing is that even though I have e-mailed WD a few times on this problem, they would reply apologetically saying that they will extend my subsription. How does this tackle the root of the problem? If they could not have assured its overseas subscribers a consistent service, they should not have offered an 'overseas subscribers' option. Ironically, I received their letter asking for a renewal of my subscription recently with my home address clearly printed on the front of the letter.Logistic problems aside, the magazine does have its plus points. In the issues, there are useful tips for writers not simply on the craft of writing, but also on the business and spiritual aspect of the writing process as well. Occasional issues also features insights into the lives of authors to give us an idea of how and where they work, their opinions on life and the areas from which they derive their inspiration. All this from a range of authors from a range of genres. Essentially, the business of writing is also not left out.However, the magazine is not one fraught without problems. The problem with WD is that the information presented to readers is too limited and scattered. Each article though containing valuable tips on writing, does not have enough depth to really improve the work of authors if they are really implemented. In addition, because of its range, it also does not provide what some writers really want consistently, which can be a waste of time for them to read if they are subscribers. Sometimes, it does seem that the magazine is purposely limiting the information that they give to readers in order to encourage further buying of future issues. This for example, can be seen in the amount of publishers' addresses that they offer. At most, each specific article on a particular topic contains on average 7-10 addresses. There is nothing wrong with this, but why would an author want to waste his time to have bits and pieces of such information when he can just purchase a Writer's market collection of publishers(and agencies) addresses collected into one? And ironically again, the same company does publish a 'Writer's Market' collection which is of excellent quality annually.That said, the same problem - the lack of information and depth, is also seen in the advice and tips it gives as well. To make matters worse, every issue is usually cluttered with a plethora of advertisements that can be frustrating to readers at times. Writers want to organise their time and information, not add on to it. If you want are thinking of subscribing to WD, do consider the alternatives that are currently available. Writing is a craft that requires more common sense and acumen than many would like to think. However, if you are not particularly concerned with little information fed to you in slower dozes or are not too worried about a little more untidiness in your life, than this magazine might be for you.

169,Amazon,,"Besides pretty much knowing the ending shortly after the beginning, the movie is just dumb. The characters for the most part are flat, the twists are unbelievable, and everything in the story lacks any reality. The incredibly high tech bank is run on a rack of pc equipment, but somehow is now run remotely and all of the maintenance terminals are missing. As if the full rack of gear needs some green screens in order to work. Sorry. Then of course the hackers need to do a home invasion in order to get physical access to the system. Hmm. And then they take several days, only to stumble when the maintenance terminals are missing. So, in a flash of brilliance Harrison Ford rips out the scanning bar from an all in one printer and plugs it into an ipod. And then tapes it to the screen so that they can capture the screen output.

171,Amazon,,"This movie had great reviews, so I was eager to watch it, but threw it in the trash afterwards. Sadly, this is an example of historical revisionism, not a ""true story."" I'd give it zero stars if that were possible.The real Tisquantum (nicknamed Squanto) was an adolescent, not a married young man, when kidnapped by Spanish, not English, slave traders. He was purchased on the slave block by monks, who taught him the Spanish language and the Christian faith. He lived with them for five years, until they secured a home for him with an English family in London. In England Squanto learned a second language, English, and waited another five years until he found passage back to North America. When he finally arrived home, he found his tribe completely wiped out from disease (they had no immunity to pathogens picked up accidently from the Europeans) -- that one bit the movie did correctly report -- and in his sorrow went to live in seclusion in the wilderness near his tribal village.  A year or so later, Samoset found him, told him of the Pilgrims who'd settled in his village, and encouraged him to meet with them. There was no near-war between Pilgrim and Native American hostile to them (hostilities did happen, but later); no chief's son who was saved from death by the joint actions of a European doctor and American Medicine Man. It just didn't happen the way this movie depicts.Instead, the Pilgrims were amazed that Squanto spoke English. According to their records, he welcomed them, and he taught this group of non-farmers how to survive. The Pilgrims had lost huge numbers from the deadly winter, but with his help the group flourished. They also indicated he embraced the Christian faith.This film skips over all this completely, and adds in terrible material such as being thrown in a pit to fight a bear for the entertainment of the British population. Not only did that never happen to Squanto, there's no record that any Native Americans were treated that way in Europe.This isn't to say that the Native Americans weren't abused by Europeans -- they were, and much of the relations between them were poor. But that sad truth doesn't justify completely re-writing Sqanto's story just to prove some kind of point.Sometimes filmmakers are flexible with history for the purposes of creating a more exciting story (frankly, much of human history is kind of boring). But I wish they hadn't changed this one.

172,Amazon,,"..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women.  First it was Britney Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone.  The former at least have something going for them; Britney's first album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard.Try as I might, though, I just don't understand the appeal of Joss Stone.  I didn't buy this album; a friend of mine likes it and I've had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head.  I don't see what is fresh or original about ripping off Janis Joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers.  Maybe it's the Rick Astley effect: you don't expect THAT voice coming out of THAT face.  You don't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat.  But that effect can only take you so far, as Rick Astley himself found out. This album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs (""Dirty Man"" basically just repeats ""You're a dirty man..."" with very minor variations, along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice of Stone herself - it's a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk, when it can't come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more ""cool"".  Stone, like Aguilera and Spears, tries to sing like an older black woman, a woman with soul - an Aretha Franklin or a Gloria Gaynor.  But Stone et al. sound like little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes.  They haven't been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate.  Their singing rings hollow to me, show-offy and fake.Stone could rival Aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics, though she has nowhere near Aguilera's sweetness or range.  Her voice might be described as ""smoky"" by some; to me it sounds gravelly, sandpapery, and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt. I don't understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this CD, much less enjoy it.  I guess fake is good enough for some people.  It makes me chuckle, though, to hear people rave about her voice as ""authentic"".   If you're looking for soul, try Macy Gray.  She's for real.  Try the hugely talented but woefully ignored Tasmin Archer and Karen Rodriguez.  Those are fresh, authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks Joss Stone and her ilk truly are.The only white woman I have ever heard who could sing like she was black was Linda Ronstadt.  Go back and listen to a Ronstadt classic like ""Hurts So Bad"" and compare it to this modern-day drivel.  Ronstadt sang with real feeling, real knowledge, real pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days.

The original movie was a near horror masterpiece and relied on atmosphere rather than gore, while the first sequel was bearable if completely routine. This one is just a load of rubbish.  Donna D'Errico, from Baywatch (what a spectacle of credibility), stars as Caroline McKeever, the great great granddaughter of the feared Candyman (Tony Todd once again), once a normal man but now an apparition who appears to slaughter everyone around you if you dare to say his name five times in front of a mirror.  Caroline says his name five times in front of a mirror and up he pops to murder her nearest and dearest. As the Candyman hacks his way through various bad actors, Caroline teams up with new pal David (Nick Corri) to find a collection of paintings knocked up by the Candyman while he was still alive, which may hold the key to stopping him. There's not a single thing here that isn't scavenged from the first ""Candyman"" film and every other ropy horror movie produced since caveman days. The screenplay is so lazy it can't even be bothered to connect half the characters to the plot, the photography is bright and glossy, which is at odds with what's supposed to be a dark story, while nothing in the direction adds any atmosphere at all. Anyone could have directed this movie, so little effort has been put in to make it scary, while the ending is an outrageous cop out. No thought has gone in to developing themes or structuring the plot because no one here is talented enough to give this movie any depth beyond having D'Errico running around in a variety of tight vests.  The rest of the performances are poor too, although none are quite as bad as D'Errico's pathetic attempts at screaming and breathing erratically.  Surely more can be done with characters like the Candyman than the constant repetition of scenes where he appears to stick his hook through someone's stomach.  The fact that the makers of this movie think Candyman is so terrifying that the very sight of him just standing there will strike fear into our hearts is a sign that they just can't be bothered even to try something a bit different.

Far from that, this cacophony from John Lennon & Yoko Ono is unlistenable.  Anyone who describes Yoko's 26+ minutes of screeching and hacking like a shrew in her death-throes on ""Cambridge 1969"" as ""free-form jazz"" vocalizing is, at best, viewing this wretched performance through John Lennon's rose-coloured granny glasses; more likely, they are unwilling to admit that this and the other two albums like it (""Unfinished Music #1: Two Virgins"" and ""The Wedding Album"") are unmitigated garbage.  In short they are either dishonest or stupid!What?  The great John Lennon associated with something that is not pure greatness?  Time to wake up and admit the truth.

Check out ""Sometime In New York City"" and get back to me), and this, along with the other two albums mentioned previously, is at the bottom of that barrel.John & Yoko tried to describe this as ""avant garde"" art at the time, but nothing could be further from the truth.  George Harrison, in his brief liner notes for the re-release of his 1969 album of electronic noodlings at the then-recently invented the Moog synthesizer, ""Electronic Sound,"" had a more honest assessment: ""Avant-Garde-A-Clue!""The rest of the tracks aren't worth much mention.

Full Eclipse came across as a job for B actors and everyone dutifully showed up said their lines worked on the set, put a way lame BUT completed film in the can and promptly went home to gag in isolated shame at the things they did for money that day.What I can not abide however is a movie that holds itself out to be a werewolf movie that tries unsuccessfully to be more than just a slash and burn horror fest.  In a low budget werewolf movie you don't need lots of intense background build up on the characters you just want to see liberial doses of blood, gore and entrails spead all over the place.  This movie spends way too much time slowly plodding along calling itself developing the characters.  I gave the DVD one star because it did such a bad job of developing the characters depsite almost the entire film wasted in the effort.The real criminal in the making of Full Eclipse was the editor so much background stuff that should have ended up on the cutting room floor made the final cut into the film.  The pacing of the film was so slow it put me to sleep twice before I finally managed to see all of it.  Watching this werewolf flick was profound torture and I love most werewolf flicks.  The full blooded dude to werewolf conversion in this movie was on the best I have seen but even that could not save this movie.Full Eclipse suffers from being BORING BEYOND ALL WORDS which is the one cardinal sin I will not forgive in a werewolf movie.  Given the chosen path this Werewolf movie had staked out, even I could have made a far more exciting satisfying movie than what was slapped together in Full Eclipse.  Full Eclipse is not bad HA HA is is bad... Snore Fest - ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ wake me up when it is over.  If I had a choice between watching this movie again and getting a root canal I'd be off to the dentist Office with a Big Toothy Wolflike grin with hugs for my dentist for his kindness.Full Eclipse is painfully slow so bad that when my office has its annual DVD and Book Give away for charity I intend to offer Full Eclipse up for sacrafice.  Full Eclipse is so bad I honestly do not want it in my collection and I rather pride myself on having most werewolf movies.  Full Eclipse was so bad however it is one Werewolf movie I will brag about not having in my huge collection.  If I could give Full Eclipse a less than one star rating I would.  I have rarely been more disappointed by a werewolf movie.

180,Amazon,,"I wish there was a - rating system, I would rate this at - 10 stars, the only good thing about this movie is John Digweed (he shows up at the end of the movie for 2 minutes) and Bedrocks Heaven Scent. It was such a burden having to watch this whole movie, first of all the acting is horrible and waaaaaaay overdone; Pretentious is the word. The acting was like watching those kids candy commercials were there's all these skateboarders and ""extreme"" sports figures doing tricks to advertise the candy product. Then theres all these gay love scenes, of which I found very unnecessary. If this movie shows what the rave scene really is, I feel sorry for ravers, fortunately this is not what raving is all about. This story shows a corporate-underground (hmmm those two words shouldnt be together, should they? Well they do in this movie) rave, you have the party planner sending e-mails to all these yuppys to let them know where the party is, then theres the ""going to the party"" thing, the wharehouse blah blah blah. Trying to look like a real rave, but the last I knew raves werent sponsored by Levis or Starbucks!! Then you have all these horrible actors trying to act like there all high on ecstasy, they just over do it, its like watching your granny trying to act like she's drunk. Then theirs the dj's who act like their mixing by grabbing records, putting them on the turntable and cranking up the crossfader, any dj knows its not that simple. I'm not trying to disrespect the dj's, I bet John Digweed did a tiny part in this movie because the he probably got ditched by a club owner that didnt pay him for a gig and he needed the money to get back home. Part of the movie is about this ""raver-couple"" who met each other like 2 days ago and are getting married, their ""love"" being completely influenced after using ecstasy (the love drug) and the dudes brother who is a complete pretentious nerd. The raver dude all the sudden is kissing another dude who is supposed to be the official rave massage guy!! I mean WTF?!!! Then his brother (pret. nerd) gets a hold on some E, of course he's never done any kind of narcotics or substance before, and he starts tripping and turns into a complete fool, he meets a chick who is supposed to be a veteran raver and she tries to guide him around his trip, then at the party he invites everyone for breakfest at his house, of course that doesnt happen because he didnt really like the people, he was just E happy. Thank God theres and end to the movie, and at the end you get to see Digweed playing heaven scent, thats the only good part of the movie and it lasts like 2 minutes. Oh I forgto to mention the ""police bust"". The police arrive at the party and the party organizer talks his way and gets a sngle cop to leave without checking any paper work or permit for the party, then later on the copps arrive and shut the party down in a raid like fashion, but guess what? No one gets arrested and the sound equipment doesnt get confiscated, the cops just run in the warehouse and run everybody out. Of course the nature of this movie wouldnt just let the people go home and stop filming this atrocity, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, the people go back to the warehouse, break the police lock and continue the party from where they left off. Totally unreal. The raver-couple chick see her boyfriend kissing the massage guy and runs to the bathroom to cry, her boyfriend follows her and tells her that he's not gay, and of course they get back together and go back dancing, then when the partys done the raver-couple dude sees the massage guy and tells him ""I'm not gay"" and the massage dude replies ""Nah, me neither"".

181,Amazon,,"If it weren't for the cover photo and Stewart's name on the CD cover, ""Still the Same...Great Rock Classics of Our Time"" could pass for a Ronco collection of oldies as performed by sound-alike artists. The title alone is enough to suggest a cheap, lazy and monetary-based package. The content does nothing to alleviate this impression, either. I could say that this is the last straw, but Stewart established his artistic indifference decades ago, sometime around ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy."" The truth nowadays is that Rod Stewart is to popular music what the interstate is to a road trip; bland, predictable, overly familiar and safer than the road less taken. Here is a guy who once fronted one of the best rock and roll bands of all time (Faces), and released gloriously eclectic and challenging solo albums. Sometime around 1974, though, the muse left him, or maybe the creativity of Ronnie Lane and Ronnie Wood are what left. Once his affiliation with that band became history, so did Stewart's sense of artistry. Ever since, he has been shilling second-rate material to an audience that demands virtually nothing from him. As a consequence, that is more or less exactly what he has offered in return. The less demanding his material, the more that some people seem to love it. It's a formula that works great for the man, and I don't want to begrudge him any of his fame or fortune. McDonalds sells a lot of hamburgers, Budweiser sells a lot of beer, and Rod Stewart sells a lot of records. All of them manage to do this by extracting `flavor' from the ingredients list and avoiding anything else that could make their product distinctive.  If you think that Stewart's collections featuring songs from the great American songbook were brilliant, then of course you will enjoy an album where he carbon copies rock artists who once may have been copying him. At least Sam Cooke preceded Stewart and could provide genuine inspiration, but Bonnie frikkin' Tyler's ""It's a Heartache?"" It's more like a travesty. If you feel compelled to defend this collection, then please tell me what Stewart adds to John Fogerty, Bob Seger, and Elvin Bishop's material? Is there one good reason on God's green earth why you would prefer Stewart's connect-the-dots cover of ""Day After Day"" over Badfinger's beautiful original version? He sounds like a bad jukebox in a biker bar. I am telling you that this record sucks, but you probably think I'm being elitist, so go ahead. Next time you're buying Cheerios at K-Mart, pick up a copy. If the CD doesn't offend you, then you can get in queue to hear Stewart as he sings the phone book, too, but I for one will not be standing in that line.

There's not much of interest going on here, and the small castle suffers from lazy design.The colorful Knights Of Morcia are back, once again fighting against Vladek, the black knight.  Two of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple), and we also get Vladek, a dark soldier, and a skeleton.

Our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories.  Swords and shields, and a black hatchet for the henchman.The scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster.  The creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and Technic parts, and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers.  The blue knight is accompanied by his horse, who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side.The scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle, which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered.  High atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it.  The rest of the castle is just walls, floors, and a staircase.  This castle is very fragile.  Mine fell apart several times while I was working on building it.  On the whole, the design just isn't all that great.  Handle with care, and play with care.  Colors are mostly black, dark gray, dark red, and brown.  This set has one of those nice walls with the barred window, and some signature Knights Kingdom battlement pieces.This set works as an addition to Vladek's Dark Fortress.  On its own, it's stunningly less impressive.  The good news is that a savvy Lego Maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them.My verdict:  one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your other Knights Kingdom adventures), one thumb down for the rest.

186,Amazon,,"I have a confession to make...I am a closet Kutless fan. I enjoyed a few of their songs on their self-titled review and even found myself identifying with ""Sea of Faces"" before CCM and CHR made it the most overplayed song of the year. The worship album wasn't bad, seeing it had several strong tracks and a few re-worked praise tunes that I found myself enjoying. I bought Hearts of the Innocent on Amazon used since I wasn't exactly sure to expect from their new album (and being a youth pastor, I don't exactly have all that much money to spend on music). After listening to this album, I found myself enjoying the music a little more, but the lyrics a lot less. I've always found Kutless's lyrics and songwriting style to be their weakest point. They tend to take about two lines of cliche followed by a thundering pre-chorus word or short-lived line to a repeated line of chourus 3 or 4 times (see Pride Away on their first album). Now, it seems they've found something to say, and I'm a little worried about the message they're sending out. Their first single, ""Shut Me Out"", has an interesting lyrical twist that I honestly didn't expect from Kutless. Essentially the song seems (notice I say seems, I could be wrong as I am not the one who wrote the song in question) to say that I'm going to say what I've got to say and I don't care whether you agree with me or not, I'm going to put up with you and your differing opinions/argumenative ways so I can speak my peace. In other words, I'm right and you're wrong but I'll put up with you being wrong so all the rest of these people can see how right I am. Seems a bit sketchy to me and not quite the message I'm shooting to teach my students how to live out their faith, because it's not about being right, it's about loving God and the people God brings into their lives (I know, someone will start lecturing about doctrine and such, but having attended and graduated a fundamentalist Bible college, please save your time and focus on the point of this review, that being the music/message of the band). Their other single ""Smile"", also sends mixed messages. According to the song, by my smiling and having a good attitude, or perceived attitude, or by seeing another person smile, they have the light of Christ in their lives. I am not exactly sure what that's supposed to mean. Many Christ-followers find themselves in situations that are very much less than the ideal, whether that be abusive relationships, poverty, or even a disconnectedness with the church. Many of them don't go around smiling with some sort of ""pie-in-the-sky/it's all gonna be ok"" mindset. They hurt. They really hurt. So the best we can offer them is a smile? I'd take some Prozac over this sort of ""Jeszac"" they're selling my kids. In conclusion, I'm not attacking the ministry of Kutless, I think they reach people in the name of Jesus and do good things for the kingdom. I just happen to disagree very strongly with much of the unoriginal lyrics and the drab music they are producing. Just my opinion. Feel free to disagree with me, but don't get angry and start lecturing.

187,Amazon,,"This was my first year using Turbotax, and it's also my last!Since 1992 I was a faithful user of HR Block's Taxcut for Mac.  In spite of it costing more than the Windows version, I used it every year except for 1995 when various problems related to my AOL dial-up service prevented me from using it.  Since TurboTax is the only option out there for people who use a Mac, you'd think I'd be continuing to use them for now on, - but you'd be wrong!I purchased my copy of TurboTax Deluxe from Amazon.com to save $5.  Since TaxCut made certain that no information from it's software could ever be imported by other software, I filled in my personal data as I began.  I was a little disappointed that TurboTax doesn't allow you to skip the ""step-by-step"" method, and just fill in the actual forms the way TaxCut did as an option.    While the downloads were an annoyance (6 or 7 separate files each time), for the most part the software was OK.  Picking up from where you leave off wasn't always possible, but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back to the right spot.My first major annoyance came with the state software.  After filling in some data, and seeing the overall results, I wanted to look at the forms to see what they were doing with my data.  I also needed to see where they had placed data that was imported from the federal information I'd entered.  Well, there's no way to see your data on state forms until you're finished and print them out (or preview as .pdf files from the print dialogue).  When you do that the software somehow magically creates the state forms for printing, but the state forms don't seem to exist anywhere else except in that print spool!  I found this extremely annoying, and a real time waster.The final blow, however, was when I got to filing.  The advertising is an unnecessary annoyance.  Since I don't owe any state taxes, I just usually print those forms out and mail them in --- it doesn't make any sense to me to pay for filing something when I don't owe anything and I'm not going to benefit from that ""faster"" refund.  Then I came to the crusher.  TurboTax wanted $30 for e-filing my Federal forms!!  TaxCut charged $14.95 and $15.95, but then they always rebated the cost.  I was told that Intuit used to do that, but obviously they decided to make some additional money this year.  Earlier in the day that I filed the saw the head of the IRS on CNBC being interviewed. He said that e-filing makes their job so much simpler.  Well, if it helps them that much, they should devise a way for computer users who buy software to file returns directly to the IRS without Intuit, H R Block and the others as middlemen.  And they should let us file for free if it makes their work so much easier.While I have had my doubts about the services that allow you to fill out online forms, and then do your filing for you, I haven't heard of any security problems with them, so that's the direction I'm planning to take next year.

191,Amazon,,"     This movie was so horrible I don't know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, ""I'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus"" Yet she's dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large.

2-s2.0-0038102554,OA,Attitudes towards rehabilitation needs and support from assistive technology and the social environment among elderly people with disability,"This study aimed to survey the attitudes of elderly people with disabilities who were living at home regarding their support from assistive technology and the social environment. These attitudes were compared with their identified needs by an occupational therapist and in relation to perception of social engagement, loneliness and overall contentment with life. From a sample of 102 participants who were interviewed using a standardized procedure, 53 persons were included in the study. The results indicated that attitudes among elderly people towards social and occupational engagement and change have a greater influence on their rehabilitation status than their disability as indicated by their health condition and limitations in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. The elderly people who accepted rehabilitation were more able, and were better equipped and better supported with assistive technology, than those who declined rehabilitation. Rehabilitation needs that the occupational therapists recognized were not always shared by the disabled elderly people, for several reasons; one reason of particular importance was the elderly person's attitude towards change and social engagement. However, the small sample size limits the generalization of the findings to the population of elderly people with disabilities.

This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility.

2-s2.0-84994525328,OA,The experiences of working carers of older people regarding access to a web-based family care support network offered by a municipality,"Policy makers in Sweden and other European Member States pay increasing attention as to how best support working carers; carers juggling providing unpaid family care for older family members while performing paid work. Exploring perceived benefits and challenges with web-based information and communication technologies as a means of supporting working carers' in their caregiving role, this paper draws on findings from a qualitative study. The study aimed to describe working carers' experiences of having access to the web-based family care support network ‘A good place' (AGP) provided by the municipality to support those caring for an older family member. Content analysis of interviews with nine working carers revealed three themes: A support hub, connections to peers, personnel and knowledge; Experiencing ICT support as relevant in changing life circumstances; and Upholding one's personal firewall. Findings indicate that the web-based family care support network AGP is an accessible, complementary means of support. Utilising support while balancing caregiving, work obligations and responsibilities was made easier with access to AGP; enabling working carers to access information, psychosocial support and learning opportunities. In particular, it provided channels for carers to share experiences with others, to be informed, and to gain insights into medical and care issues.

2-s2.0-85042472266,OA,Absorbent products for incontinence,"Absorbent products that collect and contain urine and fecal loss due to bladder and bowel dysfunction are commonly utilized as a first-line defense and daily management option for those experiencing incontinence. Unlike feminine hygiene products that are designed to absorb menstrual blood, these Class 1 medical devices (classified by the United States [US] Federal Drug Administration) are specifically designed to absorb and contain urine and feces. Absorbent products are also useful in mitigating the potential clinical complications from incontinence, such as skin irritation, breakdown, and the development of wounds in the perineal area. High-performing products are also vital in supporting individuals in dealing with the very stressful psycho-social implications of incontinence, such as embarrassing visible leakage, unpleasant odors, and even social isolation (Payne D. Selecting appropriate absorbent products to treat urinary incontinence. Br J Community Nurs. 2015;20(11):551-8). Individuals that benefit from other treatment options for incontinence, such as behavioral interventions, drug therapies, or surgical procedures, can utilize absorbent products as an adjunct for additional protection, personal hygiene, and confidence. These products are particularly useful in supporting persons who are unable to benefit from other treatments or interventions and therefore remain incontinent, such as disabled individuals, the elderly, or the very ill. To meet the varied needs of individuals and their lifestyles, these products include a variety of designs, absorbency levels, and options for use, and are utilized across the continuum of care, from the active and independent consumer at home, to the mostly immobile or bed-bound dependent patient in a clinical care setting. These products can be readily accessed to provide treatment in clinical settings, or purchased through retail channels in stores or via the web online. Over the past decade, as acuity rates and accompanying medical conditions have increased while the population ages, there is rising demand for more options in this product category, which has even been cited as the fastest-growing household product business (Eisen S. Betting on boomers, P and G enters the adult diaper market. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Consumer News and Business Channel; 2014). This demand has also led to increased research and continuous innovation by manufacturers to capture more market share, as they invest heavily to out-perform competitors, capture consumer confidence, and increase the conversion rate to their brands. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",long,2633,380,neutral,,bad,"Absorbent products that collect and contain urine and fecal loss due to bladder and bowel dysfunction are commonly utilized as a first-line defense and daily management option for those experiencing incontinence .<q>Absorbent products are also useful in mitigating the potential clinical complications from incontinence , such as skin irritation , breakdown , and the development of wounds in the perineal area .<q>These products can be readily accessed to provide treatment in clinical settings , or purchased through retail channels in stores or via the web online .","Absorbent products that collect and contain urine and fecal loss due to bladder and bowel dysfunction are commonly utilized as a first-line defense and daily management option for those experiencing incontinence .

The burden of dementia care often falls on the family members, entailing heavy psychosocial and economic consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the caregiver's perspective concerning the support for disease management on behalf of the physicians and the local Sicilian administrations (Italy), and the burden of care and effects on their lifestyle, to propose new prevention strategies and service for managing dementia and caregiver's burden. Fifty-nine caregivers of Italian elderly people with dementia (mean age, 73; age range: 63-83) were interviewed, and 55 of them completed an ad hoc self-report questionnaire composed of 54 multiple-choice questions. Our findings suggest that caregivers need more information on the disease's management, as well as on how to deal with the stress due to the disease burden. Moreover, a negative perception about the services offered from the local administration emerged. Assistive technology (AT) could be useful in promoting interaction between general practitioners and specialized centers for diagnosis, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments, and in saving costs.

2-s2.0-85041044193,OA,The use of facebook advertising to recruit healthy elderly people for a clinical trial: Baseline metrics,"Background: This report provides data on the use of social media advertising as a clinical trial recruitment strategy targeting healthy volunteers aged 60 years and older. The social media advertising campaign focused on enrollment for a Phase 1 clinical trial. Traditional means of recruiting-billboards, newspaper advertising, word of mouth, personal referrals, and direct mail-were not producing enough qualified participants. Objective: To demonstrate the effectiveness of using targeted advertising on the social networking site Facebook to recruit people aged 60 years and older for volunteer clinical trial participation. Methods: The trial sponsor used a proactive approach to recruit participants using advertising on social media. The sponsor placed and monitored an Institutional Review Board-Approved advertising campaign on Facebook to recruit potential candidates for a Phase 1 clinical trial. The clinical trial required a 10-day residential (overnight) stay at a clinic in Michigan, with one follow-up visit. The sponsor of the clinical trial placed the advertising, which directed interested respondents to a trial-specific landing page controlled by the Contract Research Organization (CRO). The CRO provided all follow-up consenting, prescreening, screening, and enrollment procedures. The campaign was waged over an 8-week period to supplement recruiting by the CRO. Results: A total of 621 people responded to a Facebook advertising campaign by completing an online form or telephoning the CRO, and the clinical trial was fully enrolled at 45 subjects following an 8-week Facebook advertising campaign. Conclusions: An 8-week Facebook advertising campaign contributed to 868 inquiries made regarding a Phase 1 clinical trial seeking to enroll healthy elderly subjects. Over the initial 11 weeks of recruitment, 178 inquiries were received using traditional methods of outreach. Respondents to the Facebook advertising campaign described in this report engaged with the sponsored advertising at a higher rate than is typical for social media-based clinical trial recruitment strategies. The older adults' engagement rate of 4.92% was more than twice as high as click-Through rates of younger adults engaged with social media advertising in other clinical trial recruitment studies. Advertising placed on the social media platform Facebook is effective with the healthy volunteer population aged 60 years and older. This approach can quickly and cost-effectively reach qualified candidates for clinical trial recruitment as a supplement to traditional means of recruiting.

2-s2.0-84923169959,OA,Happiness and social exclusion of indigenous peoples in Taiwan - A social sustainability perspective,"Introduction: Happiness and social inclusion are important indicators of social sustainability, as recommended in the Sustainable Development Goals; however, little is known about the social sustainable development of ethnic minorities. To fill this knowledge gap, special attention is paid to understanding the issues of social exclusion and happiness in relation to the indigenous peoples in Taiwan. Methods: Data used were drawn from a nationwide representativeness survey of the Taiwanese Indigenous People in 2007; it included 2,200 respondents. This study employed binary logistic regression to examine the effects of different domains of social exclusion on the likelihood of perceiving happiness; other exogenous factors, were controlled. Results: The results show that among the respondents, mountain indigenous peoples, females, the elderly and those who are healthier, wealthier, highly educated, possessing western beliefs, and are more likely to be happy, compared to their counterparts. As expected, the results reveal that the likelihood of being happy is higher for those who have received medical benefits, as well as those persons without housing problems or financial difficulties, compared to their excluded counterparts. However, no significant association is found between happiness and some social exclusion domains, such as child and youth benefits, and unemployment benefits. Conclusions: The disengagement of the indigenous peoples in mainstream society, with respect to the accessibility of welfare provisions, is a crucial element in regard to social exclusion and happiness. Several policy implications for the social sustainability of indigenous peoples can be inferred from these findings. For example, providing a mobile clinical tour, on-site health counseling, or homecare service can contribute to the removal of institutional and geographic barriers to medical welfare provisions for the mountain indigenes. Moreover, the government may devote more welfare resources to assist indigenous families and tribal communities to develop their own social safety net, instead of the individual-oriented welfare provisions. © 2015 Jiun-Hao Wang.",long,2172,306,suboptimal,neutral,bad,"Results : The results show that among the respondents , mountain indigenous peoples , females , the elderly and those who are healthier , wealthier , highly educated , possessing western beliefs , and are more likely to be happy , compared to their counterparts .<q>To fill this knowledge gap , special attention is paid to understanding the issues of social exclusion and happiness in relation to the indigenous peoples in Taiwan .<q>Methods : Data used were drawn from a nationwide representativeness survey of the Taiwanese Indigenous People in 2007 ; it included 2,200 respondents .","Introduction : Happiness and social inclusion are important indicators of social sustainability , as recommended in the Sustainable Development Goals ; however , little is known about the social sustainable development of ethnic minorities .

Adults of different ages may share motivations for companionship and affection, but dating profiles may reveal differences in adults' goals. Theories addressing age-related changes in motivation suggest that younger adults are likely to emphasize themselves, achievements, attractiveness, and sexuality. Older adults are likely to present themselves positively and emphasize their existing relationships and health. Method: We collected 4,000 dating profiles from two popular websites to examine age differences in self-presentations. We used stratified sampling to obtain a sample equally divided by gender, aged 18-95 years. We identified 12 themes in the profiles using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (Pennebaker, Booth, & Francis, 2007). Results: Regression analyses revealed that older adults were more likely to use first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, our) and words associated with health and positive emotions. Younger adults were more likely to use first-person singular pronouns (e.g., I, my) and words associated with work and achievement. Discussion: Findings suggest that younger adults enhance the ""self"" when seeking romantic partnership.

The practical application of such systems are often found to be too complicated, too costly, and users, both older adults and professional caregivers, lack adequate motivation or experience to use the systems effectively. Methods: This paper describes a personal home telehealth system - Care Deliver Frame (CDF) - for older adults based on social networking, which transforms the home telehealth system into a platform for communication and care between older adults and their family members. The system is linked to existing social networking sites such as Facebook to encourage interpersonal communication between older adults and younger family members.

2-s2.0-85025120905,OA,Cumulative Dynamics of Independent Information Spreading Behaviour: A Physical Perspective,"The popularization of information spreading in online social networks facilitates daily communication among people. Although much work has been done to study the effect of interactions among people on spreading, there is less work that considers the pattern of spreading behaviour when people independently make their decisions. By comparing microblogging, an important medium for information spreading, with the disordered spin glass system, we find that there exist interesting corresponding relationships between them. And the effect of aging can be observed in both systems. Based on the analogy with the Trap Model of spin glasses, we derive a model with a unified power-function form for the growth of independent spreading activities. Our model takes several key factors into consideration, including memory effect, the dynamics of human interest, and the fact that older messages are more difficult to discover. We validate our model by a real-world microblogging data set. Our work indicates that, other than various features, some invariable rules should be considered during spreading prediction.

2-s2.0-84934325062,OA,The relationships that matter: Social network site use and social wellbeing among older adults in the United States of America,"An increasing number of middle-aged and older Americans are using social network sites (SNSs), but little research has addressed how SNS use is associated with social wellbeing outcomes in this population. Using a nationally representative sample of 1,620 Americans older than 50 from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we examine the relationship between older adults' SNS use and social wellbeing associated with non-kin and kin relations and explore how these associations vary by age. Results of ordinary least-squares regression analyses suggest that SNS use is positively associated with non-kin-related social wellbeing outcomes, including perceived support from friends (β = 0.13; p < 0.001; N = 460) and feelings of connectedness (β = 0.10; p < 0.001; N = 463). Regression models employing interaction terms of age and SNS use further reveal that SNS use contributes to feelings of connectedness to a greater extent as people age (β = 0.10; p < 0.001; N = 463). Of all kin-related social wellbeing outcomes, SNS use only predicts increased perceived support from children (β = 0.08; p < 0.05; N = 410), and age negatively shapes this relationship (β = -0.14; p < 0.001; N = 410).

Mobile applications (apps) have been developed to facilitate CBT-I in the general population. However, because of deteriorating perceptual and cognitive functioning, the effectiveness of mobile apps in older adults remains unknown. Materials and Methods: This case report aims to demonstrate the utilization, advantages, and limitations of mobile app-assisted CBT-I in an older female adult. An app (""Win-Win aSleep"" [WWaS]) was applied in a six-session CBT-I treatment. Results: The patient successfully discontinued her hypnotics and had restored sleep quality after the intervention with WWaS-assisted CBT-I. Several limitations of WWaS were summarized, and pertinent approaches for enhancing future work were discussed. Conclusions: Mobile apps integrating wearable devices might overcome the difficulty for applying WWaS in older adults.

We used self-report data from six waves of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health over 14 years. A total of 12,338 women participating in the midage cohort (aging from 45-50 to 59-64) provided self-report indications of DE at Surveys 1 and 2, and QoL (SF-36 component scales-mental [MCS] and physical [PCS]) at Surveys 2-6. DE was reported by 10.98% of the women; this group also reported significantly poorer mental and physical QoL than those without DE, and this effect was sustained over time. Comparison with a parallel analysis of a younger cohort of women showed that the effect on midage women's physical QoL is greater than that of the younger women. The relationships between baseline DE and changes in QoL (both physical and mental) over time were mediated by levels of depressive symptoms and of social support over time.

2-s2.0-84929392417,OA,Psychosocial aspects on the use of technology by older people: A comparative study of the United Kingdom and Brazil,"Purpose: Older people perceive themselves as uncomfortable in using technology and also lack confidence in their abilities both learn and manage these systems effectively1. The related aspects of difficulty with use include specifics that evolve as older people age and experience bodily changes from the aging process. These specific factors include levels of education, gender, previous contact and experience with technologies, and access. Other factors include things such as lack of confidence in ability and motivation, concerns related to information security, attitudes towards use, changes in cognitive skills involving memory, information processing speed, attention span, decisionmaking abilities, and crystallized intelligence. These factors are based on models of acceptance and recognition of the usefulness and ease of use of using technology2. This study aims to describe the perception of the elderly on the use of technology in everyday life, by focusing on the psychosocial and family related aspects of the use of technology by older adults. Method: This is an exploratory, cross-sectional, descriptive study involving 100 adults and elderly subjects, 50 Brazilian and 46 British adults and four respondents from abroad who have been living in the UK for more than ten years. For convenience, the sample included 30 males and 70 females (16 males/34 females in The UK and 14 males/36 females in Brazil). These participants were active, educated subjects with about 15 years of formal education and older than 50 (British sample mean age of 66.1, Brazilian sample mean age of 67, overall median of 66.9 years) from different social-economic classes who presented with preserved functional capacity for instrumental daily-living activities (IDLA) and no cognitive impairment. The procedures for data collection included a social-economic questionnaire, an IDLA index, the Lawton & Brody scale3, and a self-reported, structured questionnaire with closed and semi-closed questions on the perception of the use of electronic devices. Results & Discussion: Various respondents feel task-dependence and the difficulty in using electronic devices causes them to depend on other people. This dependence is reported by 69.2% and 62.9% of the British and Brazilian subjects, respectively. However, the Brazilians report that they feel more embarrassed, pressured and nervous when they need to use certain electronic devices in public compared to the British elderly; these feelings also result in a self-perception of incompetence and inability regarding the use of new technologies. Exposure time to technology had a positive impact during the most advanced phases of use, which was supported by reports of fewer difficulties in the use of such devices, a feeling of greater confidence, and a sense of belonging to the modern world-aspects mainly reported by British subjects. The frequency of use of electronic devices in daily life, the ability to use them, use perception in public, resulting in a stressful experience were shown to be the main differences between the British and Brazilian groups. Brazilians started using computers and mobiles more recently than the English group. 30% of the British sample reported that they have begun to use computers, 30% cell phones, 22% tablets, and 14% e-readers (e.g. Kindle, Kobo). In the Brazilian sample, 48% had begun using computers, 62% cell phones, 6% tablets, and 2% e-readers, within the past 12 months. Both recognized that new technologies facilitate contact, had difficulty using these devices and felt dependent on others.

Many young adults easily take photos, share them across multiple social networks using smartphones, and create digital identities for themselves consciously and unconsciously.

As part of a larger mixed-methods study of online life in the UK, we considered digital photographic practices at two life transitions: leaving secondary school and retiring from work. In this paper, we report on a complex picture of different kinds of interactions with visual media online, and variation across age groups in the construction of digital identities. In doing so, we argue for a blurring of the distinctions between Chalfen’s ‘Kodak Culture’ and Miller and Edwards’ ‘Snaprs’. The camera lens often faces inwards for young adults: tagged ‘Selfies’ and images co-constructed with social network members commonly contribute to their digital identities. In contrast, retirees turn the camera’s lens outwards towards the world, not inwards to themselves. In concluding, we pay special attention to the digital social norms of co-creation of self and balancing convenience and privacy for people of varying ages, and what our findings mean for the future of photo-sharing as a form of self-expression, as today’s young adults grow old and retire. © 2017 International Visual Sociology Association.",medium,1400,215,neutral,neutral,neutral,"As part of a larger mixed-methods study of online life in the UK , we considered digital photographic practices at two life transitions : leaving secondary school and retiring from work .<q>Many young adults easily take photos , share them across multiple social networks using smartphones , and create digital identities for themselves consciously and unconsciously .<q>In this paper , we report on a complex picture of different kinds of interactions with visual media online , and variation across age groups in the construction of digital identities .","Over the last two decades , digital photography has been adopted by young and old .

2-s2.0-84928698845,OA,Physiotherapists' perceived motivators and barriers for organizing physical activity for older long-term care facility residents,"Background: Information regarding factors that hinder or stimulate older adults in long-term care facilities (LTCF) for being physically active is available in the literature, but much less is known regarding perceived motivators and barriers among physiotherapists (PTs) to organize physical activity (PA) in LTCF. Objective: The main purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing PTs to organize PA in LTCF for older adults. A secondary goal was to examine the PTs' knowledge about and their barriers at the PA guidelines for older adults of the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods: A mixed qualitative and quantitative study was carried out using semistructured interviews (n=24) followed by an online survey (n=254). As a frame the social-ecological model (McLeroy) was used, distinguishing factors at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community level. Results: In the qualitative component the PTs reported 41 motivators and 35 barriers for organizing PA in LTCF. The survey revealed that although the majority of the respondents (71%) are convinced of the usefulness of PA in LTCF, 84% are not familiar with the WHO-guidelines. Seventy-five percent of the respondents believe that the WHO-guidelines are not feasible for LTCF-residents. The strongest motivators on the intrapersonal level were maintaining the independence of the residents (98%), reducing the risk of falling (98%), and improving the physical (93%) and psychological (90%) wellbeing of LTCF-residents. The social interaction among LTCF-residents (91%) during PA was the strongest motivator on the interpersonal level. Motivators on the community level are the belief that PA is the basis of their physiotherapeutic work (89%) and that offering varied activities avoids PA becoming monotonous (71%). Barriers on the intra- and interpersonal level were of less influence. On the community level, they felt hindered to organize PA because of lack of time (38%) and the overload of paperwork (33%). Conclusions: This study described different motivators and barriers for PTs to organize PA in LTCFs. The majority does not know the WHO guidelines regarding the amount of PA for adults aged 65 and over. Although they agree that the guidelines are useful, they believe the guidelines are not feasible.

One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine.

The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

Thus it is important to investigate whether and how attitudes toward robots can change. In this pilot study we investigate attitudinal changes in elderly citizens toward a tele-operated robot in relation to three parameters: (i) the information provided about robot functionality, (ii) the number of encounters, (iii) personality type. Fourteen elderly residents at a rehabilitation center participated. Pre-encounter attitudes toward robots, anthropomorphic thinking, and personality were assessed. Thereafter the participants interacted with a tele-operated robot (Telenoid) during their lunch (c. 30 min.) for up to 3 days. Half of the participants were informed that the robot was tele-operated (IC) whilst the other half were naïve to its functioning (UC). Post-encounter assessments of attitudes toward robots and anthropomorphic thinking were undertaken to assess change. Attitudes toward robots were assessed with a new generic 35-items questionnaire (attitudes toward social robots scale: ASOR-5), offering a differentiated conceptualization of the conditions for social interaction. There was no significant difference between the IC and UC groups in attitude change toward robots though trends were observed. Personality was correlated with some tendencies for attitude changes; Extraversion correlated with positive attitude changes to intimate-personal relatedness with the robot (r = 0.619) and to psychological relatedness (r = 0.581) whilst Neuroticism correlated negatively (r = -0.582) with mental relatedness with the robot. The results tentatively suggest that neither information about functionality nor direct repeated encounters are pivotal in changing attitudes toward robots in elderly citizens. This may reflect a cognitive congruence bias where the robot is experienced in congruence with initial attitudes, or it may support action-based explanations of cognitive dissonance reductions, given that robots, unlike computers, are not yet perceived as action targets. Specific personality traits may be indicators of attitude change relating to specific domains of social interaction. Implications and future directions are discussed. © 2015 Damholdt, Nørskov, Yamazaki, Hakli, Vesterager Hansen, Vestergaard and Seibt.",long,2328,321,neutral,neutral,good,"Pre-encounter attitudes toward robots , anthropomorphic thinking , and personality were assessed .<q>In this pilot study we investigate attitudinal changes in elderly citizens toward a tele-operated robot in relation to three parameters : ( i ) the information provided about robot functionality , ( ii ) the number of encounters , ( iii ) personality type .<q>for up to 3 days .","Attitudes toward robots influence the tendency to accept or reject robotic devices .

2-s2.0-85018289164,OA,Cardioverter defibrillator implantation and immediate effects on patient lifestyle,"Introduction: Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (ICDs) recipients are considered high risk for sudden death. Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation history, ejection fraction <30% and coronary heart disease are some of the indications for their application. Other signs are the presence of arrhythmias due to right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite its life-saving potential, the holistic approach of ICD therapy carries a risk for physiological, psychological consequences and may affect the recipients lifestyle. Aim: The aim of this study was the investigation of patients' comparative assessment the general health, physiological and psychological state and the quality of life after the recent implanted defibrillator. Methods: The study population consisted of 65 patients (44 men and 21 women) who were recent recipients of implantable cardioverter defibrillator. There was no shockable patient. Data were collected through a telephone interview with the patients, using a questionnaire which included social and demographic characteristics and the rest were based from SF-36, DURU QUESTIONNAIRE and General Health and self-esteem questionnaires. Results: The reliability of the questionnaire was very good based on the internal consistency Cronbach index (a=0.732). The parameters of physiological and psychological status, general health and overall the quality of life of people after recent defibrillator implantation showed no significant measurable differences. However, the socio-demographic parameters, gender (female vs male), age (<vs> 50 years), educational level (> vs <graduates High School, colleges & universities) and workers differentiate significantly the parameters of self-esteem, quality of life, general health, daily physical and social activities. Most vulnerable in this study are women, elder patients, workers. Moreover, it was found a positive correlation between patients' educational level and daily roles limitation (p=0,002). There were no more statistically important correlations between marital status and quality of life in both the physical health axis (physical functioning, role fulfillment limitation, pain/body image, general health) and mental health axis (emotional well-being, social functioning, view of life with the ICD). Conclusions: The technology progress of ICDs with the improvement of the implantation procedure minimized the negative influence they use to have in recipients' quality of life. But, there are some demographic characteristics which continue to be independent risk factors for worse quality of life after implantation. More researches should take place in order to be found better approaches of ICD recipients for improvement of their physical and psychosocial well-being.",long,2798,382,neutral,neutral,bad,"Introduction : Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators ( ICDs ) recipients are considered high risk for sudden death .<q>Other signs are the presence of arrhythmias due to right ventricular dysplasia , long QT syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .<q>Methods : The study population consisted of 65 patients ( 44 men and 21 women ) who were recent recipients of implantable cardioverter defibrillator .","Introduction : Implantable cardioverter/defibrillators -LRB- ICDs -RRB- recipients are considered high risk for sudden death .

This study examines the predominance of the residential context within older adults’ everyday lives. Method: We provided 60 older adults in four New York City neighborhoods with iPhones, which captured Global Positioning Systems (GPS) locations at 5-min intervals over 1 week (n = 55,561) and 17 ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) over 4 days (n = 757) to assess real-time activities. Results: Older adults in our sample spent nearly 40% of their time outside of their residential tracts and they visited 28 other tracts, on average. Exercising, shopping, socializing, and social activities were especially likely to take place outside of residential tracts. Differences in residential and nonresidential poverty exposure vary across gender, race/ethnicity, education, car ownership, and residential areas. Discussion: Measuring activity space, rather than relying on residential tracts, allows examination of the social environments that are relevant for older adults’ everyday lives.

2-s2.0-84905105899,OA,Age management concept - opportunity or threat,"As human age prolongs, also the retirement age limit of employees moves. Today sixty-year-old person - if not affected by any serious health handicap - is still a person full of energy, power and, yet, mature and experienced enough to handle regular work tasks as well as unpredictable situations not possible to manage only by a routine approach. (Jenšík, 2013) Currently, the Age Management Concept, i.e. personnel management considering age and changing skills of employees within organisation, starts to be applied and implemented to some extent within the human resources management area. Thus, the organisation management, within this concept, should approach to every single employee differently, understand their individual needs, support their continuous growth or development, and, on the other hand, accept their limits or weaknesses. These weaknesses should be minimised or removed completely in the employee - organisation management mutual synergy. It is, thus, obvious that each employee shall have other positives and other negatives not only regarding the gender, work performance or position, but also with regard to the biological age. In this context, Vortelová (2013) presents the research of Manpower conducted in 2007 and focused on individual generations of employees from the perspective of social categories for the area of human resources management. It involves five generations of employees in total where one generation is limited by the duration approximately of 15 years. It concerns the generation of Pre- Boomers: employees born before 1946, and further the generation of Baby Boomers: employees born within the years from 1947 to 1960. The third generation is the X Generation: employees born during the years from 1961 to 1975. Typical for this generation is that the people are willing to work hard, they have distinctive individualistic features, money means value for them, and they strive not to run into debts, they make clear decisions between their family and career, and have rather pessimistic view of the world. The third generation is called Y Generation: employees born during the years from 1976 to 1990. This generation only sees money as a mean and willingly run into debts, requires good remuneration for work, willingly changes working places and, usually, does not seek any sense in the job, and requires more flexible working hours. The fifth generation is indicated as Z Generation: employees born during the years from 1991 to 2005. This youngest generation is highly interconnected and globalised, is constantly online, and uses advanced means of communication and technology. Pillinger (2008) or Polčáková (2011) define the Age Management Concept as a complex approach leading to the solution of demographic changes at the work place, supporting age diversity and management of work processes within the physical and social environment. The article offers a view to some of the partial results of quantitative and qualitative research conducted within the author's doctoral thesis focused on specific aspects of personnel management of employees of the age category 50+ in conditions of Czech and Slovak organisations and, further, of TACR (Technology Agency of the Czech Republic) grant project, OMEGA Programme to support applied social-science research and experimental development, registration No. TD010129, Performance Potential of Employees 50+, and specific forms of companies' human resources management. The main purpose of the article is to initiate discussion over the Age Management Concept or philosophy itself.

The aim of the study was to investigate opinions of occupational therapy students (OTS), as future professional caregivers, on the use of robots in care for older people. Methods. It included 26 OTS from Poznan University of Medical Sciences. To collect data, the Users’ Needs, Requirements, and Abilities Questionnaire (UNRAQ) was developed. Findings. OTS perceived the robot as “a useful device” and “an assistant” rather than “a companion” (P < 0.01). In their opinion, the most important functions of the robot were related to health aspects (emergency alarms, health parameters monitoring, physical activity and memory training, and reminders about medication, drinks, etc.), scored positively by 23-26 OTS. Functions such as mood detection, encouraging to contact with friends, and monitoring of food consumption were accepted by 16-17 OTS. Two statements concerning social functions (accompanying in everyday activities and decreasing the sense of loneliness) were rated positively by less the than half of the participants.

2-s2.0-84925216389,OA,Return to work in sick-listed cancer survivors with job loss: Design of a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Despite long-term or permanent health problems, cancer survivors are often motivated to return to work. For cancer survivors who have lost their job, return to work can be more challenging compared to employed survivors, as they generally find themselves in a more vulnerable social and financial position. Cancer survivors with job loss may therefore be in need of tailored return to work support. However, there is a lack of return to work intervention programs specifically targeting these cancer survivors. The number of cancer survivors with job loss in developed countries is rising due to, amongst others, increases in the incidence and survivor rate of cancer, the retirement age and the proportion of flexible employment contracts. Hence, we consider it important to develop a tailored return to work intervention program for cancer survivors with job loss, and to evaluate its effectiveness compared to usual care. Methods/Design: This study employs a two-armed randomised controlled trial with a follow-up period of 12 months. The study population (n=164) will be recruited from a national sample of cancer survivors (18-60 years), who have been sick-listed for 12-36 months. Participants will be randomised by using computerized blocked randomisation (blocks of four). All participants will receive usual care as provided by the Dutch Social Security Agency. Additionally, participants in the intervention group will receive a tailored return to work intervention program, which includes vocational rehabilitation and supportive psychosocial components, as well as (therapeutic) placement at work. The primary outcome measure is duration until sustainable return to work; the secondary outcome measure is rate of return to work. Other parameters include, amongst others, fatigue, coping strategy and quality of life. We will perform Cox regression analyses to estimate hazard ratios for time to sustainable return to work. Discussion: The hypothesis of this study is that a tailored approach for cancer survivors with job loss is more effective, regarding return to work, compared to usual care.

2-s2.0-85016293704,OA,Computer classes and games in virtual reality environment to reduce loneliness among students of an elderly reference center,"Introduction: Physical and mental changes associated with aging commonly lead to a decrease in communication capacity, reducing social interactions and increasing loneliness. Computer classes for older adults make significant contributions to social and cognitive aspects of aging. Games in a virtual reality (VR) environment stimulate the practice of communicative and cognitive skills and might also bring benefits to older adults. Furthermore, it might help to initiate their contact to the modern technology. The purpose of this study protocol is to evaluate the effects of practicing VR games during computer classes on the level of loneliness of students of an elderly reference center. Methods and Analysis: This study will be a prospective longitudinal study with a randomised cross-over design, with subjects aged 50 years and older, of both genders, spontaneously enrolled in computer classes for beginners. Data collection will be done in 3 moments: moment 0 (T0) - at baseline; moment 1 (T1) - after 8 typical computer classes; and moment 2 (T2) - after 8 computer classes which include 15 minutes for practicing games in VR environment. A characterization questionnaire, the short version of the Short Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults (SELSA-S) and 3 games with VR (Random, MoviLetrando, and Reaction Time) will be used. For the intervention phase 4 other games will be used: Coincident Timing, Motor Skill Analyser, Labyrinth, and Fitts. The statistical analysis will compare the evolution in loneliness perception, performance, and reaction time during the practice of the games between the 3 moments of data collection. Performance and reaction time during the practice of the games will also be correlated to the loneliness perception. Ethics and Dissemination: The protocol is approved by the host institution's ethics committee under the number 52305215.3.0000.0082.

2-s2.0-85037706351,OA,Everybody's working for the weekend: changes in enjoyment of everyday activities across the retirement threshold,"BACKGROUND: the aim of this study was to explore the associations between use of time and momentary hedonic affect ('enjoyment') in adults in the peri-retirement period.METHODS: a total of 124 adults [61 males, 63 females; age 62 (4) years] completed a computerised use-of-time recall on 4 days at each of four time points (3-6 months pre-, 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement), as well as surveys regarding self-reported health, well-being, sleep quality and loneliness. They reported how much they enjoyed each activity on a 0-10 scale. An individual Enjoyment Index was calculated as the time-weighted average of each participant's enjoyment ratings. Time-weighted enjoyment ratings were also calculated for nine mutually exclusive and exhaustive activity domains (Sleep, Chores, Work, Social, Screen Time, Self-care, Quiet Time, Transport, Physical Activity) and sub-domains.RESULTS: the mean (±SD) Enjoyment Index was 7.43 ± 0.61, and was significantly and positively associated with well-being (P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001) and sleep quality (P = 0.03 to P < 0.0001), and negatively associated with loneliness (P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001). Mean Enjoyment Index values increased significantly (P < 0.0001) from pre-retirement (7.19 ± 0.82) to post-retirement (7.46 ± 0.89, 7.42 ± 0.91 and 7.49 ± 0.89 at 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement).

2-s2.0-85031091663,OA,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,neutral,neutral,neutral,"Research on older adults ' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse .<q>Older adults can use the Internet for different activities , and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE : The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS : We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands .<q>Respondents in Cluster 2 , the `` minimizers '' ( 32.23 % , n=457 ) , reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities , are older ( mean age 73 years ) , and spent the smallest time on the Internet .","Research on older adults ' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse .

As China is probably the largest personal data pool and vastest application market of big data, the situation of Chinese privacy trust plays a significant role. Based on the 17 most common data collection scenarios, the following aspects have been observed through 508 questionnaires and interviews of 20 samples.To start with, there is a severe privacy trust crisis in China, both in the field of enterprise services such as online shopping and social networks, etc. and in some public services like medical care and education, etc. Besides, there are also doubts about data collected by the government since individuals refuse to offer personal information or give false information as much as possible. Some people even buy two phone numbers, one is in use, while the other is not carried around or used by them, which is only bought to be offered to data collectors. Secondly, in terms of gender, females have lower trust in enterprises and social associations than males, especially in the fields of social networks and personal consumption. However, there is no obvious difference in fields of government and public services. Females possess stronger awareness but less skilled in precautions than males. Thirdly, people between the ages of 18 and 50 are more suspicious of data collected by enterprises, while age exerts little obvious influence on the credibility of data collected by the government, social associations and public services. Older people are less aware of precautions than people at other ages. In addition, from the perspective of education background, people with higher degrees possess stronger awareness of precautions and thus lower degree of trust. Therefore, it is suggested that more education on privacy consciousness should be given, and relative laws as well as regulations need improving. Besides, innovation in privacy protection technologies should be encouraged. What is more, we need to reinforce the management of the internet industry and strictly regulate personal data collection of the government. © 2015 Zhong Wang & Qian Yu.",long,2264,356,neutral,neutral,neutral,"Privacy trust directly affects the personal willingness to share data and thus influences the quality and size of the data , thus affecting the development of big data technology and industry .<q>Besides , there are also doubts about data collected by the government since individuals refuse to offer personal information or give false information as much as possible .<q>Based on the 17 most common data collection scenarios , the following aspects have been observed through 508 questionnaires and interviews of 20 samples.To start with , there is a severe privacy trust crisis in China , both in the field of enterprise services such as online shopping and social networks , etc .","Privacy trust directly affects the personal willingness to share data and thus influences the quality and size of the data , thus affecting the development of big data technology and industry .

2-s2.0-85015308850,OA,Media and technology use among hispanics/latinos in New York: Implications for health communication programs,"Objectives There is limited information about media and technology use, as well as health information-seeking patterns, specifically for Hispanics/Latinos at the state level. An understanding of access, usage patterns, and preferences for receiving health information is critical for state-level organizations to effectively reach and serve this growing population. Design A telephone survey was developed to assess media and technology access, use patterns, health-seeking information patterns, and preferences for receiving health information. The survey was conducted in New York state from August 8 to November 4, 2013, using random digit dialing. The overall sample of 1350 included 412 Hispanic/Latino adults who are the focus of this study. Results Most Hispanic/Latino respondents reported having at least one working computer at home (78%) and using the Internet (84%); almost all who had a computer reported having high-speed Internet service (90%). Cell phone ownership was common (88%), and many had a smartphone (71%). Activities most likely to occur several times per day were sending text messages (61%), using phone apps (49%), using a search engine (40%), using email (34%), and using social networking sites (32%). The most preferred channels of receiving health information were websites, mail, and television. Older respondents were significantly less likely to have the technologies, engage in technology activities, and prefer newer forms of information dissemination (i.e., text messages). Education and income were important predictors in some cases. Conclusions While most Hispanics/Latinos have access to various technologies, the reason for using those technologies and preferences for receiving health information most often varies by age and, sometimes, by education and income. Older adults tend to seek health information from traditional sources such as television and brochures, while younger adults favored newer technologies. Knowing preferences of the population can help ensure proper media channels are selected for dissemination of health information to Hispanic/Latino communities. © W.

2-s2.0-84929411059,OA,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,neutral,neutral,good,"The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China 's communities1 today .<q>Method : First , reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors .<q>Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement .","Purpose : A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China .

Methods: The psychometric properties of the Dutch WHOQOL-OLD were examined in a cross-sectional study using a sample of 1,340 people aged 60years or older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the 'Senioren Barometer'. Reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha and corrected item-total correlations. Construct validity of the Dutch WHOQOL-OLD was evaluated with confirmatory factor analyses, and correlations within and between scales, using scales WHOQOL-BREF, Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), and the Emotional and Social Loneliness Scale (ESLS). Results: The reliabilities of the six WHOQOL-OLD facets or subscales were sufficient to good (.66-.91). The convergent validity of the WHOQOL-OLD was good, whereas our findings on the divergent validity of the WHOQOL-OLD were somewhat mixed. Findings corroborating the divergent validity were that the 6-factor model fitted better than the second-order factor model, and WHOQOL-OLD facets sensory abilities, past, present and future activities, death and dying, intimacy correlated more strongly with similar than dissimilar scales. Not fully supporting divergent validity were the extremely high correlations between the factors corresponding to autonomy, past, present and future activities, and social participation.

Facebook is the most popular service with over 1.23 billion users. Online Social Networks have the potential to combat feelings of social isolation amongst the aging population. Nevertheless, many older people do not use online social networks given the barriers resulting from a lack of understanding and perceived usefulness. This paper presents the findings from a ten week training course were participants were trained in the use of Facebook and EasiSocial, a newly introduced web application which displays Facebook in a manner which is more suitable for older people. An evaluation study was undertaken of both applications in an effort to gain insight into the reasons why older people (50–80 years old) do not use social media.

2-s2.0-85041000466,OA,Cognitive flexibility training: A large-scale multimodal adaptive active-control intervention study in healthy older adults,"As aging is associated with cognitive decline, particularly in the executive functions, it is essential to effectively improve cognition in older adults. Online cognitive training is currently a popular, though controversialmethod. Although some changes seempossible in older adults through training, far transfer, and longitudinal maintenance are rarely seen. Based on previous literature we created a unique, state-of-the-art intervention study by incorporating frequent sessions and flexible, novel, adaptive training tasks, along with an active control group. We created a program called TAPASS (Training Project Amsterdam Seniors and Stroke), a randomized controlled trial. Healthy older adults (60-80 y.o.) were assigned to a frequent- (FS) or infrequent switching (IS) experimental condition or to the active control group and performed 58 half-hour sessions over the course of 12 weeks. Effects on executive functioning, processing- and psychomotor speed, planning, verbal long term memory, verbal fluency, and reasoning were measured on four time points before, during and after the training. Additionally, we examined the explorative question which individual aspects added to training benefit. Besides improvements on the training, we found significant time effects on multiple transfer tasks in all three groups that likely reflected retest effects. No training-specific improvements were detected, and we did not find evidence of additional benefits of individual characteristics. Judging from these results, the therapeutic value of using commercially available training games to train the aging brain is modest, though any apparent effects should be ascribed more to expectancy and motivation than to the elements in our training protocol. Our results emphasize the importance of using parallel tests as outcome measures for transfer and including both active and passive control conditions. Further investigation into different training methods is advised, including stimulating social interaction and the use of more variable, novel, group-based yet individual-adjusted exercises. © 2017 Buitenweg, van de Ven, Prinssen, Murre and Ridderinkhof.",long,2161,302,neutral,neutral,good,"Online cognitive training is currently a popular , though controversialmethod .<q>As aging is associated with cognitive decline , particularly in the executive functions , it is essential to effectively improve cognition in older adults .<q>Based on previous literature we created a unique , state-of-the-art intervention study by incorporating frequent sessions and flexible , novel , adaptive training tasks , along with an active control group .","As aging is associated with cognitive decline , particularly in the executive functions , it is essential to effectively improve cognition in older adults .

2-s2.0-3042718475,OA,Three year health outcomes among older women at risk of elder abuse: Women's Health Australia,"Background: Older women are at increasing risk of various forms of familial violence, yet detection is poor and very little is known of the longterm health effects of this psychosocial problem. The effectiveness of the 'Vulnerability to Abuse' Screening Scale (VASS) in predicting three year health outcomes was investigated among women enrolled in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, now known as Women's Health Australia. Methods: The sample comprised a cohort of 10,421 women aged 73-78 who completed the 1996 and 1999 postal surveys (attrition rate 19.5%). The Time 2 sample had a small bias towards lower risk for elder abuse at Time 1 and better health on SF-36 and self-rated health. The VASS is a 12-item self-report measure with 4 factors: vulnerability, coercion, dependence and dejection. Results: Overall, physical health (PCS) declined while mental health (MCS) increased over the three year period. Decline in physical health was predicted by only the dejection factor, but not by factors which seem to more directly measure abuse. The predictive validity of the VASS for three year mental health outcomes was given partial support. Three of the four VASS factors (dejection, vulnerability, and coercion) predicted decline in mental health at the univariate level, however, after adjusting for confounders, only one VASS factor (dejection) independently predicted decline in mental health. Conclusions: While the VASS shows some promise as a marker of health risk in older women, only the dejection factor proved consistently predictive of declining health status.

2-s2.0-85028289846,OA,Information and communication technology use is related to higher well-being among the oldest-old,"Objectives: Older adults often prioritize socially meaningful goals over informational goals. Thus, we predicted that using information and communication technology (ICT) in service of socially meaningful versus informational goals relates to higher well-being among the oldest-old. Method: We surveyed 445 adults aged 80+ (mean = 84, range = 80–93; 64% female; 26% non-White) online or via telephone. Participants reported motivations for ICT use (connect with others, learn new information) and rated their psychological and physical well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, loneliness, goal attainment, subjective health, functional limitations). We conducted regression and mediation analyses to test our hypothesis. Results: Participants used ICT more to connect with friends/family (M = 3.66, SD = 1.28) than to learn information (M = 2.61, SD = 1.44), p < .001. Overall, ICT use predicted higher well-being across outcomes, ps ≤ .008. Motivations for use differentially mediated these effects: Social motivations mediated the relationships between ICT use and psychological well-being, whereas informational motivations mediated the relationships between ICT use and physical well-being. Discussion: Older adults aged 80+ use ICT less than other generations, but may have much to gain. Using social versus informational technologies may enhance multiple aspects of well-being in different ways during very late life.

Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-84925130006,OA,Characteristics associated with willingness to participate in a randomized controlled behavioral clinical trial using home-based personal computers and a webcam,"Background: Trials aimed at preventing cognitive decline through cognitive stimulation among those with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment are of significant importance in delaying the onset of dementia and reducing dementia prevalence. One challenge in these prevention trials is sample recruitment bias. Those willing to volunteer for these trials could be socially active, in relatively good health, and have high educational levels and cognitive function. These participants' characteristics could reduce the generalizability of study results and, more importantly, mask trial effects. We developed a randomized controlled trial to examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation delivered through personal computers, a webcam and the internet would have a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. To examine the selectivity of samples, we conducted a mass mail-in survey distribution among community-dwelling older adults, assessing factors associated with a willingness to participate in the trial. Methods: Two thousand mail-in surveys were distributed to retirement communities in order to collect data on demographics, the nature and frequency of social activities, personal computer use and additional health-related variables, and interest in the prevention study. We also asked for their contact information if they were interested in being contacted as potential participants in the trial. Results: Of 1,102 surveys returned (55.1% response rate), 983 surveys had complete data for all the variables of interest. Among them, 309 showed interest in the study and provided their contact information (operationally defined as the committed with interest group), 74 provided contact information without interest in the study (committed without interest group), 66 showed interest, but provided no contact information (interest only group), and 534 showed no interest and provided no contact information (no interest group). Compared with the no interest group, the committed with interest group were more likely to be personal computer users (odds ratio (OR)=2.78), physically active (OR=1.03) and had higher levels of loneliness (OR=1.16). Conclusion: Increasing potential participants' familiarity with a personal computer and the internet before trial recruitment could increase participation rates and improve the generalizability of future studies of this type. © 2014 Dodge et al.",long,2483,349,good,neutral,good,"We developed a randomized controlled trial to examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation delivered through personal computers , a webcam and the internet would have a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment .<q>Those willing to volunteer for these trials could be socially active , in relatively good health , and have high educational levels and cognitive function .<q>These participants ' characteristics could reduce the generalizability of study results and , more importantly , mask trial effects .","Background : Trials aimed at preventing cognitive decline through cognitive stimulation among those with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment are of significant importance in delaying the onset of dementia and reducing dementia prevalence .

2-s2.0-84887957045,OA,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,neutral,neutral,good,"The service development focused on three categories of services : cognitive activities , social activities , and physical activities .<q>Loneliness and social isolation can , however , be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services .<q>Objective : This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly , and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them .","Background : There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today .

Methods This study is based on population survey data of 1097 respondents aged 65 to 80 years old, who were Internet users and non-users, respectively. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed, comparing emotional, social and physical health status (based on items from the Short Form Health Survey, SF-12) between Internet users and respondents not using the Internet. Also, a post hoc multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed. Results Internet use was associated with emotional health status (OR 0.58 (0.39-0.86), 95%CI), but not physical or social health status when controlling for socio-demographic variables. More specifically, respondents using the Internet for hobby or entertainment (OR 1.68 (1.02-2.76), 95%CI) and work or study purposes (OR 2.37 (1.03-5.49), 95%CI) exhibited a better emotional health status than respondents not using the Internet. Conclusions Results add to the growing body of research emphasizing the need for increased focus on evolving societal determinants which may complicate, support or protect the psychosocial health of older individuals.

2-s2.0-84862164688,OA,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment.

2-s2.0-84929417715,OA,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,neutral,neutral,neutral,"It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults .<q>Method : In 2013 , twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone .<q>To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences , Singtel , a local telecommunication company , has initiated a project called Silverline .","To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences , Singtel , a local telecommunication company , has initiated a project called Silverline .

2-s2.0-25444491977,OA,Depression in older people in rural China,"Background: In Western countries depression is the most common psychiatric condition in older persons and related to low socioeconomic status and low social supports. Along with social deprivation, the rural communities in China retain many Chinese traditions that involve high levels of social supports. Studying such a population might offer insights into the cause and prevention of depression that may be applicable in developing and developed countries. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, household-based, community survey in rural China, we aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for depression among older people who had a low income (mean annual per capita income of about US $280) and high social support in 16 villages in Anhui Province. Participants included 754 men and 846 women aged 60 years or older. Depression was diagnosed using the Geriatric Mental State and the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy. Risk factors, collected from the standard questionnaire and physical measurements, were examined in a stepwise multiple logistic regression model. Results: The prevalence of depression (world age standardized) was 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8%-7.3%). Of all persons, 1374 older persons (85.9%) living with family members. Depression was significantly and independently associated with female gender, low family income, lack of social support, relationship problems, poor health status, and adverse life events in the past 2 years. The risk of depression increased in those eating meat less than once a week (multiple-adjusted odds ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.20-4.03), not watching television (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.00), and having undetected hypertension (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.05-3.01). Conclusions: Older people in rural China have a lower risk of depression than those in Western countries. Low socioeconomic status showed a ""dose-response"" relationship with depression, and social supports were much more common, which were protective for depression.

Face-to-face contact through video-calls may help reduce loneliness, but little is known about the processes of engaging people in care environments in using video-calls. We aimed to identify the barriers to and facilitators of implementing video-calls for older people in care environments. Methods: A collaborative action research (CAR) approach was taken to implement a video-call intervention in care environments. We undertook five steps of recruitment, planning, implementation, reflection and re-evaluation, in seven care homes and one hospital in the UK. The video-call intervention 'Skype on Wheels' (SoW) comprised a wheeled device that could hold an iPad and handset, and used Skype to provide a free video-call service. Care staff were collaborators who implemented the intervention within the care-setting by agreeing the intervention, recruiting older people and their family, and setting up video-calls. Field notes and reflective diaries on observations and conversations with staff, older people and family were maintained over 15 months, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four care homes implemented the intervention. Eight older people with their respective social contacts made use of video-calls. Older people were able to use SoW with assistance from staff, and enjoyed the use of video-calls to stay better connected with family. However five barriers towards implementation included staff turnover, risk averseness, the SoW design, lack of family commitment and staff attitudes regarding technology. Conclusions: The SoW intervention, or something similar, could aid older people to stay better connected with their families in care environments, but if implemented as part of a rigorous evaluation, then co-production of the intervention at each recruitment site may be needed to overcome barriers and maximise engagement. © 2018 The Author(s).",medium,1988,290,neutral,neutral,good,"The video-call intervention 'Skype on Wheels ' ( SoW ) comprised a wheeled device that could hold an iPad and handset , and used Skype to provide a free video-call service .<q>Methods : A collaborative action research ( CAR ) approach was taken to implement a video-call intervention in care environments .<q>We undertook five steps of recruitment , planning , implementation , reflection and re-evaluation , in seven care homes and one hospital in the UK .","Face-to-face contact through video-calls may help reduce loneliness , but little is known about the processes of engaging people in care environments in using video-calls .

The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs.

In this context, it is important to analyze and promote actions with the elderly population for this can be an integral and active part of the digital society, because increasingly the exercise of civic rights and duties to be carried out through digital platforms. At present, the digital society implies that all citizens are equipped with digital skills, in this particular case, given that the elderly population is referred to as computer exclusion population, it is urgent to create conditions to promote their digital inclusion that will enable them to true social inclusion thus providing active aging. Given the physiological and cognitive decline associated with aging is important to promote initiatives to prevent situations that could increase dementia among the elderly. In particular, there are already a number of digital applications (APPs) that aim to stimulation and cognitive training.

In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,suboptimal,neutral,good,"Thus , this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group .<q>The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred .<q>People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1 .","In recent years , ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults .

High levels of technophobia (fear of modern technologies or discomfort with them), however, may constrain older Internet users’ online activity and limit the benefits they derive therefrom. The literature on technophobia in later life tends to focus on nonusers and ignore older individuals who already use advanced technologies. Relying on an online survey of 537 Internet users aged 60 and up, this study explored the extent to which technophobia constrains older users’ online activity. The results demonstrated varying levels of technophobia among users and significant associations between technophobia and Internet use patterns, including type and complexity of use.

2-s2.0-84954415822,OA,Street characteristics preferred for transportation walking among older adults: A choice-based conjoint analysis with manipulated photographs,"Background: Knowledge about the relationships between micro-scale environmental factors and older adults' walking for transport is limited and inconsistent. This is probably due to methodological limitations, such as absence of an accurate neighborhood definition, lack of environmental heterogeneity, environmental co-variation, and recall bias. Furthermore, most previous studies are observational in nature. We aimed to address these limitations by investigating the effects of manipulating photographs on micro-scale environmental factors on the appeal of a street for older adults' transportation walking. Secondly, we used latent class analysis to examine whether subgroups could be identified that have different environmental preferences for transportation walking. Thirdly, we investigated whether these subgroups differed in socio-demographic, functional and psychosocial characteristics, current level of walking and environmental perceptions of their own street. Methods: Data were collected among 1131 Flemish older adults through an online (n=940) or an interview version of the questionnaire (n=191). This questionnaire included a choice-based conjoint exercise with manipulated photographs of a street. These manipulated photographs originated from one panoramic photograph of an existing street that was manipulated on nine environmental attributes. Participants chose which of two presented streets they would prefer to walk for transport. Results: In the total sample, sidewalk evenness had by far the greatest appeal for transportation walking. The other environmental attributes were less important. Four subgroups that differed in their environmental preferences for transportation walking were identified. In the two largest subgroups (representing 86% of the sample) sidewalk evenness was the most important environmental attribute. In the two smaller subgroups (each comprising 7% of the sample), traffic volume and speed limit were the most important environmental attributes for one, and the presence of vegetation and a bench were the most important environmental attributes for the other. This latter subgroup included a higher percentage of service flat residents than the other subgroups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the provision of even sidewalks should be considered a priority when developing environmental interventions aiming to stimulate older adults' transportation walking. Natural experiments are needed to confirm whether our findings can be translated to real environments and actual transportation walking behavior. © 2016 Van Cauwenberg et al.",long,2598,353,neutral,neutral,neutral,"Secondly , we used latent class analysis to examine whether subgroups could be identified that have different environmental preferences for transportation walking .<q>Thirdly , we investigated whether these subgroups differed in socio-demographic , functional and psychosocial characteristics , current level of walking and environmental perceptions of their own street .<q>Background : Knowledge about the relationships between micro-scale environmental factors and older adults ' walking for transport is limited and inconsistent .","This is probably due to methodological limitations , such as absence of an accurate neighborhood definition , lack of environmental heterogeneity , environmental co-variation , and recall bias .

The mobility needs of older wheelchair users are particularly complex due to a constellation of chronic conditions and comorbidities that may compromise optimal use of the device. The purpose of the Mobility Outcomes via Information Technologies (MOvIT) project is to examine the feasibility of automated calls for the systematic monitoring for adverse outcomes associated with wheelchair use. Methods: A two-phase mixed methods approach was used. Phase I involved user-centered development and face validation of a monitoring questionnaire with end-users (seven wheelchair users and five healthcare providers). Phase II tested the feasibility of monitoring outcomes using automated calls to administer the MOvIT questionnaire 1 and 3 months after wheelchair delivery with a prospective cohort of older adults (50-84 years of age). When problems were identified, the computer monitoring system notified a clinical coordinator who followed up with respondents requiring interventions. Feasibility data were extracted from the web database and from individual interviews covering perceived ease of use, usefulness and intention to use the MOvIT questionnaire in the future. Results: The MOvIT monitoring questionnaire developed in phase I tracks nine potential wheelchair-related adverse outcomes considered important for end-users: 1) non-use of wheelchair, 2) pain, 3) skin condition, 4) positioning, 5) wheelchair incidents, 6) psychosocial issues, 7) restricted wheelchair participation, 8) limited wheelchair skills and knowledge, and 9) technical problems. In phase II, 92 individuals who received a wheelchair were eligible, 71 out of 92 accepted (77 %) and 65 out of 71 (92 %) completed the 3-month follow-up. In the sample of 65 participants, a wheelchair-related adverse outcome was confirmed by a rehabilitation professional for 58.5 %, and at least one recommendation was given to 66.2 % during the 3-month monitoring period. A majority of participants found the intervention useful (82.8 %) and said they intended to use the MOvIT monitoring questionnaire in the future (81.5 %). Participants made suggestions to make the calls more adaptive to various ability profiles.

2-s2.0-85016997614,OA,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,suboptimal,neutral,neutral,"A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach .<q>However , research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society , spending much of their time seated or inactive .<q>The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction .","Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults , preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood .

Data sources: The sample consisted of 500 randomly selected NPs who were certified to practice in New York State. The Geriatric Curriculum Survey designed by the researchers was based on the 47 ""Older Adult Care"" competencies developed by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. The survey was mailed to the subjects along with a stamped self-addressed envelope to facilitate its return. Two hundred and twenty-two surveys (44%) were returned. Conclusions: A majority of the respondents were comfortable with their assessment skill knowledge of individuals aged 65 years and older in all areas except those related to cultural/ethnic items. Over half of the respondents were only ""somewhat comfortable"" with knowledge of management of Alzheimer's disease, delirium, dementia, neurological problems, polypharmacy, and sleep issues. Finally, respondents were asked to rate their knowledge comfort level on topics relevant to physical and psychosocial issues of individuals aged 65 years and older. The majority of respondents only felt ""somewhat comfortable"" with their knowledge on all but one of the nine items in this category. Health promotion and disease prevention was the only item that over 50% of the respondents felt ""very knowledgeable"" about. Ninety-five percent indicated they would be better prepared to care for individuals aged 65 years and older if a didactic course in geriatrics was required in their program of study. Seventy percent indicated they would consider taking an online course in geriatrics. Implications for practice: Based on the results of this study, an online, four-credit geriatric-focused course ""Issues in Geriatric Management"" was developed. The course is required in the acute care and adult NP programs. Eventually, this course will be offered as continuing education credit for practicing NPs.

2-s2.0-84921647901,OA,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones.

2-s2.0-84865446863,OA,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-85033454755,OA,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

To examine how older people navigate volunteering for a home visiting service, six visitors were interviewed and the interviews were analysed using discourse analysis. A professionalism discourse was used to construct home visiting as a structured social support service that improved the lives of isolated older people. A personal relationship discourse constructed home visiting as an opportunity to forge long-term relationships that benefit both parties. At times these two discourses created tension for home visitors. Examining how the home visiting service is described by the service organisation online explains these tensions. The online materials construct active older volunteers as providing professional services while those they visit are constructed as receiving friendship. These discourses provide different ageing identities for visitors from those they visit, which contributes to the difficulties in navigating home visiting services.

Although depression has a recognised association with stroke, the role of 'silent' cerebrovascular pathology associated with carotid stenosis and peripheral vascular disease remains unexplored. Methods. Four groups of 25 community residents aged 65 and over were recruited, comprising first anterior circulation stroke, carotid stenosis accompanied by transient ischaemic attack, peripheral vascular disease and a non-vascular control group. All participants were interviewed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD] (including a modified version) and Geriatric Depression Scale. DSM IV criteria for major depression and measures of handicap, social support and physical illness were also administered. Head computerised tomography (CT) scans were performed on stroke patients to examine the relationship between lesion location and depression. Results. One hundred patients were interviewed. Stroke patients were more likely to live in a nursing home and had less social support than other groups. Mean scores on the modified Hamilton and Geriatric Depression Scales were higher in stroke and carotid stenosis groups than controls. Patients with stroke did not show a higher prevalence of DSM IV major depressive disorder than those with carotid stenosis. There was no relationship between the presence of lesions affecting the frontal/subcortical system and prevalence/severity of depression. Limitations. Small numbers, mortality of stroke patients in hospital, possible selection bias in the control group and use of a previously unvalidated depression rating scale all limit the study. Conclusions. A possible role for carotid stenosis in the pathogenesis of depressive disorder is suggested. Larger studies incorporating brain imaging may be required to examine the mechanism of this association more closely. The use of a shorter version of the HRSD in older people with cerebrovascular disease may warrant further exploration.

However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support.

2-s2.0-84982883886,OA,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-85016217625,OA,Professional and psychosocial factors affecting the intention to retire of Australian medical practitioners,"Objective: To determine the professional and personal factors associated with the intention to retire (ITR) by medical practitioners. Design, participants and setting: Cross-sectional survey of currently practising Australian doctors aged 55 or older registered with a commercial database. Participants completed an online self-report questionnaire in October 2015. Main outcome measures: Associations between intention to retire and demographic and practice characteristics; health; emotional, social and financial resources; work centrality; and anxiety about ageing. Results: 62.0% of 1048 respondents (17.5% response rate) intended to retire, 11.4% had no intention of retiring and 26.6% were unsure. The odds of retiring were higher for those with adequate financial resources (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18-1.44) and greater anxiety about ageing (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09); the odds of retiring were lower for international medical graduates (aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.85), for those with greater work centrality (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85e 0.92) and greater emotional resources (aOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98).

Conclusion: Intention to retire was determined by a mixture of professional and psychosocial characteristics. In particular, our results support the view that delaying retirement by doctors may be related to the primacy of work compared with other life roles.

2-s2.0-84893864978,OA,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

Lack of energy, ""anergia,"" is a possible central feature for identifying, evaluating, and treating elders with health-related problems in quality of life. Methods. A survey was conducted on a randomly selected stratified sample (N = 2130) of three ethnic groups of community-residing elders in a defined urban geographic area: the Northern Manhattan Aging Project (NMAP). The participants were Medicare beneficiaries living north of 150th Street in Manhattan. The criteria for anergia were based on the presence of the major criterion ""sits around a lot for lack of energy"" and any two of six minor criteria. Self-reports were gathered using a computer-assisted, rater-administered interview (the Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Interview; CARE) covering: function (basic activities of daily living [ADL] and instrumental ADL [IADL]); features of geriatric syndromes such as self-rated physical health, depression, pain, respiratory distress, trouble sleeping, cognitive impairment, and cardiovascular syndromes; social isolation; and healthcare utilization. Short-term (18-month) and long-term (6-year) mortality were derived from the National Death Index. Results. Three hundred eighty-six people (18% of the sample) met criteria for anergia. Anergia was more common in women than men (22% vs 12%, p &lt; .01), in unmarried than in married persons (21% vs 13%, p &lt; .001), and with advancing age. People with anergia used more hospitalizations, office visits, emergency room visits, and home care services and, had higher mortality rates. In multivariate analyses, the following factors had independent associations with anergia: female gender, impaired physical function and IADL, depression, pain, respiratory symptoms, urinary incontinence, hearing difficulty, feeling dizzy or weak, and social isolation and disengagement. These factors could be the initial candidates for clinical investigation of anergia of undetermined origin. Among people with anergia at baseline, 31.3% (n = 121) had persistent anergia and 33.9% (n = 131) recovered over a follow-up period of 18 months. Conclusions.

2-s2.0-85042285324,OA,The role of social support networks in proxy Internet use from the intergenerational solidarity perspective,"Digital inequalities research has documented a set of practices related to people's Internet use that questions the binary division between Internet users and non-users. In particular, among older adults, a considerably large group of individuals has been identified as not using the Internet by themselves; rather, they ask members of their personal networks to do things online for them—they “use” the Internet by proxy. Since previous research shows that children and grandchildren are important sources of help when it comes to Internet use, the current paper indicates that the notion of intergenerational solidarity is a sound conceptual basis for understanding the relationship between social support networks and proxy Internet use among Internet non-users. Notably, the concept of functional solidarity as a dimension of intergenerational solidarity is advanced, as this relates to the frequency of the intergenerational exchange of resources and services encompassing various types of assistance and support offered between two generations. Empirically, this paper investigates how the two types of social support networks and their characteristics are associated with proxy Internet use. The results from multivariate analyses of survey data from a nation-wide representative sample show that when comparing emotional support and socializing networks, only the latter is associated with proxy Internet use: Internet non-users who have (grand-)children in their socializing support network are more likely to engage in proxy Internet use. The results also indicate that non-users who are younger, more educated, have children, and live in urban areas are more inclined to engage in proxy Internet use, regardless of the type of social support. The findings indicate the importance of empirical investigation related to different aspects of functional solidarity, as the effects on proxy Internet use depend on the type of social support. © 2017",medium,1954,288,neutral,neutral,neutral,"Digital inequalities research has documented a set of practices related to people 's Internet use that questions the binary division between Internet users and non-users .<q>Since previous research shows that children and grandchildren are important sources of help when it comes to Internet use , the current paper indicates that the notion of intergenerational solidarity is a sound conceptual basis for understanding the relationship between social support networks and proxy Internet use among Internet non-users .<q>In particular , among older adults , a considerably large group of individuals has been identified as not using the Internet by themselves ; rather , they ask members of their personal networks to do things online for them—they “ use ” the Internet by proxy .","Digital inequalities research has documented a set of practices related to people 's Internet use that questions the binary division between Internet users and non-users .

We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access.

2-s2.0-84978039774,OA,Assessing Social Isolation: Pilot Testing Different Methods,"Social isolation is a significant public health problem among many older adults; however, most of the empirical knowledge about isolation derives from community-based samples. There has been less attention given to isolation in senior housing communities. The objectives of this pilot study were to test two methods to identify socially isolated residents in low-income senior housing and compare findings about the extent of isolation from these two methods. The first method, self-report by residents, included 47 out of 135 residents who completed in-person interviews. To determine self-report isolation, residents completed the Lubben Social Network Scale 6 (LSNS-6). The second method involved a staff member who reported the extent of isolation on all 135 residents via an online survey. Results indicated that 26% of residents who were interviewed were deemed socially isolated by the LSNS-6. Staff members rated 12% of residents as having some or a lot of isolation. In comparing the two methods, staff members rated 2% of interviewed residents as having a lot of isolation. The combination of self-report and staff report could be more informative than just self-report alone, particularly when participation rates are low. However, researchers should be aware of the potential discrepancy between these two methods. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",medium,1351,205,good,neutral,neutral,The objectives of this pilot study were to test two methods to identify socially isolated residents in low-income senior housing and compare findings about the extent of isolation from these two methods .<q>There has been less attention given to isolation in senior housing communities .<q>Results indicated that 26 % of residents who were interviewed were deemed socially isolated by the LSNS-6 .,"Social isolation is a significant public health problem among many older adults ; however , most of the empirical knowledge about isolation derives from community-based samples .

2-s2.0-84955182612,OA,An Administrator's Perspective on the Organization of Physical Activity for Older Adults in Long-Term Care Facilities,"Background: The positive influence of physical activity (PA) on health is well documented. Even at old age, PA remains useful but participation in PA decreases with age. In long-term care facilities (LTCFs), PA appears to be reduced to a bare minimum. Because administrators have a key role in developing the care policy of LTCFs, it is important that they support the organization of PA in LTCFs. Objective: The main objective of this mixed-method study was to identify motivators and barriers for organizing PA in LTCFs according to administrators. A secondary goal was to examine the knowledge of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines regarding PA and to reveal potential motivators and barriers for the implementation of the guidelines. Methods: First, 24 administrators completed semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using the deductive approach of qualitative content analysis. The obtained motivators and barriers were categorized on 3 different levels (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community) according to the socioecological model by 2 independent reviewers; conflicts were resolved with a third researcher. Next, 127 administrators of Flemish (Belgium) LTCFs completed an online questionnaire survey containing open-ended, unique, and multiple choice questions regarding the LTCFs, PA, and the WHO guidelines, as well as statements (scored on a 5-point Likert scale) regarding perceived motivators and barriers for organizing PA sessions in the LTCF. Results: In the qualitative component, the administrators reported 31 motivators and 24 barriers for organizing PA in the LTCF. In the survey, maintaining or enhancing general health of the residents (98%) and improving the psychological well-being of the residents were marked as key motivators at the intrapersonal level. The administrators (97%) were convinced that PA is a useful way to spend time for LTCF residents. Encouraging social contact (94%) and countering loneliness (86%) are the motivators cited at the interpersonal level. At the community level, the infrastructure of the facility (91%) and adequate and sufficient material (88%) are the main motivators. The barriers that were presented to the participants were scored as less important. The majority of the administrators (83%) are not familiar with the WHO guidelines for PA; 70% of the participants believe that the guidelines are useful, but only 40% is convinced that it is realistic to implement the guidelines in an LTCF. Conclusions: This study described different motivators and barriers for administrators to organize PA in LTCFs. Contrary to other studies, lack of staff, lack of adequate equipment, and lack of financial resources were rejected as potential barriers for organizing PA. Despite the fact that administrators were not familiar with the WHO guidelines for PA, they believed that the guidelines are useful. The participants reported several barriers for implementation of the guidelines. Administrators of LTCFs are motivated to implement the guidelines if PA can be integrated in daily activities and education of LTCF staff regarding PA is provided. © 2016 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,3198,479,neutral,neutral,neutral,"Objective : The main objective of this mixed-method study was to identify motivators and barriers for organizing PA in LTCFs according to administrators .<q>In long-term care facilities ( LTCFs ) , PA appears to be reduced to a bare minimum .<q>In the survey , maintaining or enhancing general health of the residents ( 98 % ) and improving the psychological well-being of the residents were marked as key motivators at the intrapersonal level .","Even at old age , PA remains useful but participation in PA decreases with age .

2-s2.0-33750557199,OA,Determinants of cardiovascular disease and other non-communicable diseases in Central and Eastern Europe: Rationale and design of the HAPIEE study,"Background: Over the last five decades, a wide gap in mortality opened between western and eastern Europe; this gap increased further after the dramatic fluctuations in mortality in the former Soviet Union (FSU) in the 1990s. Recent rapid increases in mortality among lower socioeconomic groups in eastern Europe suggests that socioeconomic factors are powerful determinants of mortality in these populations but the more proximal factors linking the social conditions with health remain unclear. The HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe) study is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the effect of classical and nonconventional risk factors and social and psychosocial factors on cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases in eastern Europe and the FSU. The main hypotheses of the HAPIEE study relate to the role of alcohol, nutrition and psychosocial factors. Methods and design: The HAPIEE study comprises four cohorts in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania; each consists of a random sample of men and women aged 45-69 years old at baseline, stratified by gender and 5 year age groups, and selected from population registers. The total planned sample size is 36,500 individuals. Baseline information from the Czech Republic, Russia and Poland was collected in 2002-2005 and includes data on health, lifestyle, diet (food frequency), socioeconomic circumstances and psychosocial factors. A short examination included measurement of anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, lung function and cognitive function, and a fasting venous blood sample. Re-examination of the cohorts in 2006-2008 focuses on healthy ageing and economic well-being using face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews. Recruitment of the Lithuanian cohort is ongoing, with baseline and re-examination data being collected simultaneously. All cohorts are being followed up for mortality and non-fatal cardiovascular events.

2-s2.0-84951961928,OA,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,suboptimal,neutral,suboptimal,"To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids .<q>The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users .<q>For these cases , there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency .","Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss .

2-s2.0-84906924251,OA,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Study protocol for an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls are very common, especially in adults aged 65 years and older. Within the current international European Commission's Seventh Framework Program (FP7) project 'iStoppFalls' an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based system has been developed to regularly assess a person's risk of falling in their own home and to deliver an individual and tailored home-based exercise and education program for fall prevention. The primary aims of iStoppFalls are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention program, and its effectiveness to improve balance, muscle strength and quality of life in older people. Methods/Design. This international, multicenter study is designed as a single-blinded, two-group randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and older will be recruited in Germany (n = 60), Spain (n = 40), and Australia (n = 60) between November 2013 and May 2014. Participants in the intervention group will conduct a 16-week exercise program using the iStoppFalls system through their television set at home. Participants are encouraged to exercise for a total duration of 180 minutes per week. The training program consists of a variety of balance and strength exercises in the form of video games using exergame technology. Educational material about a healthy lifestyle will be provided to each participant. Final reassessments will be conducted after 16 weeks. The assessments include physical and cognitive tests as well as questionnaires assessing health, fear of falling, quality of life and psychosocial determinants. Falls will be followed up for six months by monthly falls calendars. Discussion. We hypothesize that the regular use of this newly developed ICT-based system for fall prevention at home is feasible for older people. By using the iStoppFalls sensor-based exercise program, older people are expected to improve in balance and strength outcomes. In addition, the exercise training may have a positive impact on quality of life by reducing the risk of falls. Taken together with expected cognitive improvements, the individual approach of the iStoppFalls program may provide an effective model for fall prevention in older people who prefer to exercise at home.

2-s2.0-85041332930,OA,Associations of Environmental Factors with Quality of Life in Older Adults,"Purpose of the Study: Environmental factors play an important role in the quality of life of older people who often have difficulty maintaining physical, psychological, and social functioning. In this study, we aimed at (a) developing a measurement instrument assessing the factors of older adults' perceptions of their environment, (b) examining the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics. Design and Methods: Associations between environmental factors and quality of life domains were examined in a crosssectional study using a sample of 1,031 Dutch people aged 65 years and older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the ""Senioren Barometer."" Forty-two questions on environmental factors were asked, and quality of life domains were assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF. Results: Seven scales (comprising 3-9 items) of environment were constructed-housing, facilities, nuisance, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. All quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) were associated with at least one environmental scale. Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with 4, 3, and 2 domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with quality of life environmental. Implications: This study showed that multiple environmental factors are associated with quality of life in older people. To support independent living in older people health and social care professionals and policymakers may need to carry out interventions, in particular focusing on housing, residents, and nuisance. © 2017 The Author(s).

2-s2.0-84927642980,OA,Who cares? Implications of care-giving and -receiving by HIV-infected or -affected older people on functional disability and emotional wellbeing,"This paper examines how care-giving to adults and/or children and care-receiving is associated with the health and wellbeing of older people aged 50+ in rural South Africa. Data used are from a cross-sectional survey adapted from World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) conducted in 2009/10 in rural South Africa. Bivariate statistics and multivariate logistical regression were used to assess the relationship between care-giving and/or care-receiving with functional disability, quality of life or emotional wellbeing, and self-rated health status, adjusted for socio-demographic factors. Sixty-three per cent of 422 older people were care-givers to at least one young adult or child; 27 per cent of older people were care-givers due to HIV-related reasons in young adults; 84 per cent of participants were care-recipients mainly from adult children, grandchildren and spouse. In logistic regressions adjusting for sex, age, marital status, education, receipt of grants, household headship, household wealth and HIV status, care-giving was statistically significantly associated with good functional ability as measured by ability to perform activities of daily living. This relationship was stronger for older people providing care-giving to adults than to children. In contrast, care-givers were less likely to report good emotional wellbeing; again the relationship was stronger for care-givers to adults than children. Simultaneous care-giving and -receiving was likewise associated with good functional ability, but about a 47 per cent lower chance of good emotional wellbeing. Participants who were HIV-infected were more likely to be in better health but less likely to be receiving care than those who were HIV-affected. Our findings suggest a strong relationship between care-giving and poor emotional wellbeing via an economic or psychological stressor pathway. Interventions that improve older people's socio-economic circumstances and reduce financial hardship as well as those that provide social support would go some way towards mitigating this relationship.

Objective: The goal of this study was to determine whether older adults' awareness of 2 major state and federal pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs was associated with the seniors' ability to access and process information about assistance programs. Methods: Data were gathered from a cross-sectional study of independently living, English- or Spanish-speaking adults aged ≥60 years. Participants were interviewed in 30 community-based settings (19 apartment complexes and 11 senior centers) in New York, New York. The analysis focused on adults aged ≥65 years who lacked Medicaid coverage. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model program awareness as a function of information access (family/social support, attendance at senior or community centers and places of worship, viewing of live health insurance presentations, instrumental activities of daily living, site of medical care, computer use, and having a proxy decision maker for health insurance matters) and information-processing ability (education level, English proficiency, health literacy, and cognitive function). The main outcome measure was awareness of New York's state pharmaceutical assistance program (Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage [EPIC]]) and the federal Medicare Part D low-income subsidy program (Extra Help). Results: A total of 269 patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 76.9 [7.5] years; 32.0% male; 39.9% white). Awareness of the programs differed widely: 77.3%) knew of EPIC! and 22.3% knew of Extra Help. In multivariable analysis, study participants were more likely to have heard of the EPIC program if they had attended a live presentation about health insurance issues (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.40; 95% CI, 1.20-9.61) and less likely if they received care in a clinic (AOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23-0.92). Awareness of Extra Help in the multivariable models was more likely among study participants who had viewed a live health insurance presentation (AOR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.55-7.24) and less likely for those with inadequate health literacy (AOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.74). Conclusions: Viewing of live health insurance presentations and adequate health literacy were associated with greater awareness of important pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs in this study in low-income, elderly individuals. The findings suggest that use of live presentations, in addition to health literacy materials and messages, may be important strategies in promoting knowledge of and enrollment in state and federal pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs for low-income seniors. © 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.

2-s2.0-84929412305,OA,PRISM measure development: The design and validation of the computer proficiency questionnaire,"Purpose: Efficient and effective computer and internet training depends on an understanding of an older adult's existing level of proficiency. However, in the development of the PRISM trial (assessing whether a specialized computer system can improve the well-being of older adults at risk for isolation), we discovered that existing measures of computer proficiency are not suitable for people targeted by the PRISM trial who do not use computers. Measures were often designed for and validated with sample populations consisting of young adults or older adults who have ample computer experience. Existing measures also contained jargon, did not focus on computer activities predicted to be important for maintaining functional independence, and focused on experience rather than proficiency. As a result, we developed a new measure of proficiency and assessed its reliability and validity within our PRISM intervention sample and a sample of older adults who have computer experience. Subscale measures focused on measuring proficiency related to computer activities that are predicted to facilitate social support, communication, information access, prospective memory, and cognitive engagement. Here we present new data from the intervention, which further validate the Computer Proficiency Questionnaire (CPQ) measurements by demonstrating increased proficiency over time after PRISM computer training and exposure. Method: After pilot testing our new CPQ, we used baseline PRISM data (n=300) in addition to a sample of computer-proficient older adults (n=76) to demonstrate the reliability and validity of the CPQ1. We also measured CPQ scores over the course of a 12-month exposure to the PRISM computer system. Results & Discussion: We previously reported that the CPQ is a valid measure which correlates with both age and technology experience and, using discriminant analysis, can easily distinguish experienced and inexperienced computer users (>94% correct classification rate). The CPQ and each of its subscales were also found to be highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha=0.98, all CPQ subscales >0.86). To further demonstrate the validity of the CPQ, we examined changes in CPQ scores of older adults in the PRISM computer condition compared to participants in the non-computer control condition. After PRISM computer training and exposure, initial analyses indicated that PRISM participants demonstrated a significant increase in overall computer proficiency compared to the control condition as measured by the CPQ. Differential improvement in proficiency was also observed on each of the CPQ subscales. The ability of the CPQ to detect changes in proficiency as a function of training further establishes it as a valid measure, and significant changes in proficiency confirm the usefulness of the training developed for the PRISM computer system and the ease with which it can be mastered.",long,2903,428,good,neutral,neutral,"As a result , we developed a new measure of proficiency and assessed its reliability and validity within our PRISM intervention sample and a sample of older adults who have computer experience .<q>Subscale measures focused on measuring proficiency related to computer activities that are predicted to facilitate social support , communication , information access , prospective memory , and cognitive engagement .<q>Existing measures also contained jargon , did not focus on computer activities predicted to be important for maintaining functional independence , and focused on experience rather than proficiency .","Purpose : Efficient and effective computer and internet training depends on an understanding of an older adult 's existing level of proficiency .

2-s2.0-84928816564,OA,"Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare Organization, structure and delivery of healthcare","Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences.

2-s2.0-84928566433,OA,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,good,neutral,suboptimal,"Methods : This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards , current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare .<q>eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone .<q>A variety of eHealth initiatives ( for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain ) have been launched across the UK , but roll out remains at an early stage .","It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed ; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services , and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review .

Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support.

Studies have shown that older adults use of social networks and online communication can increase social support, improve quality of life and increase their health. The purpose of this study was to understand the older adult's experiences of online Social Interactions. Materials and Methods: This study was performed following a qualitative approach and phenomenological methodology in Semnan (Iran) in 2016. The studied sample was taken by purposive sampling method. Required data was collected via deep and semi-structured interviews with 9 older adults who were active members of at least one online social network. The obtained data was analyzed using the seven-step Colaizzi's method. Results: From data analysis, the main theme of ""developed social interactions"" was extracted from five sub-themes: ""interaction with family and friends"", ""revival of old relationships"", ""familiar with people with common interests"", ""impalpable control"" and ""liberation from loneliness"". Conclusion: The results explained the various dimensions of the use of the older adults from online social networks and showed that these networks have the potential to be used to enhance social interactions in aging. The results of this study can help planners by identifying the benefits of these networks, while taking necessary interventions to increase the use of the elderly from these networks, promote social interactions and, consequently, promote the health of the elderly. © 2018, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

Face-to-face contact through video-calls may help reduce loneliness, but little is known about the processes of engaging people in care environments in using video-calls. We aimed to identify the barriers to and facilitators of implementing video-calls for older people in care environments. Methods: A collaborative action research (CAR) approach was taken to implement a video-call intervention in care environments. We undertook five steps of recruitment, planning, implementation, reflection and re-evaluation, in seven care homes and one hospital in the UK. The video-call intervention 'Skype on Wheels' (SoW) comprised a wheeled device that could hold an iPad and handset, and used Skype to provide a free video-call service. Care staff were collaborators who implemented the intervention within the care-setting by agreeing the intervention, recruiting older people and their family, and setting up video-calls. Field notes and reflective diaries on observations and conversations with staff, older people and family were maintained over 15 months, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four care homes implemented the intervention. Eight older people with their respective social contacts made use of video-calls. Older people were able to use SoW with assistance from staff, and enjoyed the use of video-calls to stay better connected with family. However five barriers towards implementation included staff turnover, risk averseness, the SoW design, lack of family commitment and staff attitudes regarding technology. Conclusions: The SoW intervention, or something similar, could aid older people to stay better connected with their families in care environments, but if implemented as part of a rigorous evaluation, then co-production of the intervention at each recruitment site may be needed to overcome barriers and maximise engagement. © 2018 The Author(s).",medium,1988,290,suboptimal,neutral,neutral,"The video-call intervention 'Skype on Wheels ' ( SoW ) comprised a wheeled device that could hold an iPad and handset , and used Skype to provide a free video-call service .<q>Methods : A collaborative action research ( CAR ) approach was taken to implement a video-call intervention in care environments .<q>We undertook five steps of recruitment , planning , implementation , reflection and re-evaluation , in seven care homes and one hospital in the UK .","Face-to-face contact through video-calls may help reduce loneliness , but little is known about the processes of engaging people in care environments in using video-calls .

2-s2.0-85031091663,Tech,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,neutral,neutral,good,"Research on older adults ' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse .<q>Older adults can use the Internet for different activities , and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE : The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS : We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands .<q>Respondents in Cluster 2 , the `` minimizers '' ( 32.23 % , n=457 ) , reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities , are older ( mean age 73 years ) , and spent the smallest time on the Internet .","Research on older adults ' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse .

2-s2.0-85032812646,Tech,Energy efficient wearable sensor node for IoT-based fall detection systems,"Falls can cause serious traumas such as brain injuries and bone fractures, especially among elderly people. Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient.

2-s2.0-85041590903,Tech,Facebook Use and Its Role in Shaping Access to Social Benefits among Older Adults,"Adults who are 65 years or older have increasingly adopted social network sites (SNSs), Facebook in particular. Yet the ramifications of SNS use in this population remain understudied. Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 2,003), this study focuses on Facebook users (N = 1,138) and examines patterns of Facebook use by younger (aged 18–65 years) and older users (aged 65 or older), as well as the social benefits associated with older users’ Facebook use. Findings show that older users have different network structures, but the frequency of their visits and engagement in Social Media Relationship Maintenance Behaviors (SMRMB), a measure of perceived likelihood to engage with others via social media, do not significantly differ from those of younger users. Moreover, our results suggest that among older users (N = 98), the number of self-reported “actual” friends on Facebook and SMRMB positively predict perceived support, while SMRMB contributes to perceptions of access to useful information. Overall, the study highlights unique usage patterns and social benefits associated with Facebook use among older adults.

2-s2.0-85019661194,Tech,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-85043278214,Tech,Persuasive games for intergenerational social interaction in urban environments,"Social isolation in urban areas is a societal challenge. It affects people of all ages but particularly elderly who struggle to maintain social ties into later-life. Interventions in social isolation primarily focus on elderly in clinical care, overlooking the existence of older adults who live independently. Despite facing dwindling social contact, groups of healthy older adults reside alongside large groups of younger citizens that might offer much needed social interaction. This type of intergenerational social interaction seems promising but motivations of elderly to engage with younger groups who are not necessarily related to them are not well-understood and vice-versa. Persuasive games have the potential to encouraging social interaction. This paper presents a preliminary work on investigating motivations for intergenerational interaction rooted in persuasion theory.

This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957).

Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

Understanding the way they perceive sustainability is of great significance in shaping the provision of sustainable living environments in this industry. This study explores village developers’ perceptions of a sustainable living environment through a comprehensive content analysis of their online descriptions of sustainability features of their villages. Thirty-nine sustainability features were identified, with the most mentioned being “care and services provision and accessibility”, “social interaction”, “secure/safe living” and “independent living”. The social sustainability of the retirement village environment was highly valued by developers, with the majority of the sustainability features relating to this feature, while environmental sustainability was largely ignored. Although there is no significant difference between the private and not-for-profit village developers regarding the numbers of sustainability features mentioned, the private village developers value “social interaction” more while the not-for-profit village developers prioritize “independent living” and “care and services provision and accessibility” the most. The research leads to a better understanding of retirement village developers’ perceptions on a sustainable living environment, which further reveals the meaning of sustainable retirement villages in Australia.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Tech,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85010685442,Tech,Measurement and visualization of face-to-face interaction among community-dwelling older adults using wearable sensors,"Aim: A number of interventions have been undertaken to develop and promote social networks among community-dwelling older adults. However, it has been difficult to examine the effects of these interventions, because of problems in assessing interactions. The present study was designed to quantitatively measure and visualize face-to-face interactions among elderly participants in an exercise program. We also examined relationships among interactional variables, personality and interest in community involvement, including interactions with the local community. Methods: Older adults living in the same community were recruited to participate in an exercise program that consisted of four sessions. We collected data on face-to-face interactions of the participants by using a wearable sensor technology device. Results: Network analysis identified the communication networks of participants in the exercise program, as well as changes in these networks. Additionally, there were significant correlations between the number of people involved in face-to-face interactions and changes in both interest in community involvement and interactions with local community residents, as well as personality traits, including agreeableness. Conclusions: Social networks in the community are essential for solving problems caused by the aging society. We showed the possible applications of face-to-face interactional data for identifying core participants having many interactions, and isolated participants having only a few interactions within the community. Such data would be useful for carrying out efficient interventions for increasing participants’ involvement with their community.

2-s2.0-85016997614,Tech,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,good,neutral,good,"A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach .<q>However , research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society , spending much of their time seated or inactive .<q>The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction .","Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults , preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood .

A sequential explanatory mixed method design was employed consisting of an online survey with a convenience sample of 101 men who tested positive for the breast cancer mutation following up with an in-depth interview with a subsample of 26 males who participated in the survey. The survey results revealed that 70.3% (n = 45) considered “Family Risk” as the primary reason for getting BRCA tested; 21.9% (n = 14) considered “Medical Considerations,” and 7.8% (n = 5) considered “Social Support” as their primary reason. Male participants who were 50 years old or younger or who did not have children were more likely to consider medical reasons as the primary reason to get tested. In terms of self-concept, younger men were more stigmatized than their older counterparts; married men felt a greater loss of control with regard to their BRCA-positive mutation diagnosis than single men; and professional men as a whole felt more vulnerable to the negative influences of the disease than those who had already retired. Regression analysis results indicated that negative self-concept was strongly related to sampled males’ BRCA involvement 6 months after testing. Applying an intersectional approach to health care, decision-making outcomes among BRCA-positive mutation males provides an important lens for ascertaining the within-sex/gender demographic and psychosocial factors that affect the diversity of men’s pretesting and posttesting medical decisions. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",medium,1635,247,good,good,neutral,An intersectional approach was used to understand sex/gender differences in men ’ s health decisions with regard to hereditary breast cancer ( BRCA ) .<q>A sequential explanatory mixed method design was employed consisting of an online survey with a convenience sample of 101 men who tested positive for the breast cancer mutation following up with an in-depth interview with a subsample of 26 males who participated in the survey .<q>Male participants who were 50 years old or younger or who did not have children were more likely to consider medical reasons as the primary reason to get tested .,"An intersectional approach was used to understand sex/gender differences in men 's health decisions with regard to hereditary breast cancer -LRB- BRCA -RRB- .

2-s2.0-84929676133,Tech,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,suboptimal,suboptimal,neutral,"Objective : The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic , social determinants , and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults .<q>Results : Almost 90 % of older Web 2.0 users ( 90/101 , 89.1 % ) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites , such as Facebook and Twitter , to find and share health information .","However , among these older populations , little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information .

Methods First, we determined the technical abilities and needs of middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illnesses using smartphones. Then, we developed smartphone content through principles of user-centered design and modified an existing smartphone platform. Finally, we conducted a usability test using “think aloud” and verbal probing. Results We adapted a psychosocial self-management intervention to a smartphone application and tested its usability. Ten participants (mean age: 55.3 years, SD: 6.2 years) with serious mental illness and comorbid chronic health conditions reported a high level of usability and satisfaction with the smartphone application. Conclusions Middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness and limited technical abilities were able to participate in a process involving user-centered design and adaptation of a self-management intervention to be delivered by a smartphone.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Tech,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-85017430982,Tech,Connected seniors: how older adults in East York exchange social support online and offline,"How do older adults mobilize social support, with and without digital media? To investigate this, we focus on older adults 65+ residing in the Toronto locality of East York, using 42 interviews lasting about 90 minutes done in 2013–2014. We find that digital media help in mobilizing social support as well as maintaining and strengthening existing relationships with geographically near and distant contacts. This is especially important for those individuals (and their network members) who have limited mobility. Once older adults start using digital media, they become routinely incorporated into their lives, used in conjunction with the telephone to maintain existing relationships but not to develop new ones. Contradicting fears that digital media are inadequate for meaningful relational contact, we found that these older adults considered social support exchanged via digital media to be real support that cannot be dismissed as token.

Email was used more with friends than relatives; some Skype was used with close family ties.

Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-85021730725,Tech,Facial age estimation with age difference,"Age estimation based on the human face remains a significant problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. In order to estimate an accurate age or age group of a facial image, most of the existing algorithms require a huge face data set attached with age labels. This imposes a constraint on the utilization of the immensely unlabeled or weakly labeled training data, e.g., the huge amount of human photos in the social networks. These images may provide no age label, but it is easy to derive the age difference for an image pair of the same person. To improve the age estimation accuracy, we propose a novel learning scheme to take advantage of these weakly labeled data through the deep convolutional neural networks. For each image pair, Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to embed the age difference information. The entropy loss and the cross entropy loss are adaptively applied on each image to make the distribution exhibit a single peak value. The combination of these losses is designed to drive the neural network to understand the age gradually from only the age difference information. We also contribute a data set, including more than 100 000 face images attached with their taken dates. Each image is both labeled with the timestamp and people identity. Experimental results on two aging face databases show the advantages of the proposed age difference learning system, and the state-of-the-art performance is gained. © 2016 IEEE.",medium,1458,238,neutral,neutral,neutral,"In order to estimate an accurate age or age group of a facial image , most of the existing algorithms require a huge face data set attached with age labels .<q>Age estimation based on the human face remains a significant problem in computer vision and pattern recognition .<q>These images may provide no age label , but it is easy to derive the age difference for an image pair of the same person .","Age estimation based on the human face remains a significant problem in computer vision and pattern recognition .

This study examined the relationship between changes in social support networks for older people living in a regional area following weekly videoconference groups delivered to the home. Between February and June 2014, we delivered 44 weekly group meetings via videoconference to participants in a regional town in Australia. The meetings provided participants with education and an opportunity to discuss health issues and connect with others in similar circumstances.

In addition, 14 semi-structured interviews and 4 focus groups were conducted. Following the intervention, participants identified increased membership of their social networks, although they did not identify individuals from the weekly videoconference groups. The most important social support networks remained the same pre- and post-intervention namely, health professionals, close family and partners. However, post-intervention participants identified friends and wider family as more important to managing their chronic condition compared to pre-intervention.

Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample.

One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application.

Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook.

2-s2.0-84929417329,Tech,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,good,neutral,neutral,"This paper presents the development of WOBOT , which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions , body motions , and built-in autonomous reactions .<q>WOBOT is simple , non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun ' rather than 'functions ' , hoping to aid our elders in communication , leisure , and companionship .<q>Method : WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots ' , which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways .","Purpose : Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society .

Methods: The assistive technology of the proposed system, including wearable, sleep, object motion, presence, and utility usage sensors, was methodically deployed at four different home installations of people with cognitive impairment. Detection of sleep patterns, physical activity, and activities of daily living, based on the collected sensor data and analytics, was available at all times through comprehensive data visualization solutions. Combined with clinical observation, targeted psychosocial interventions were introduced to enhance the participants' quality of life and improve their cognitive functions and daily functionality. Meanwhile, participants and their caregivers were able to visualize a reduced set of information tailored to their needs. Results: Overall, paired-sample t-test analysis of monitored qualities revealed improvement for all participants in neuropsychological assessment. Moreover, improvement was detected from the beginning to the end of the trial, in physical condition and in the domains of sleep. Detecting abnormalities via the system, for example in sleep quality, such as REM sleep, has proved to be critical to assess current status, drive interventions, and evaluate improvements in a reliable manner. Conclusion: It has been proved that the proposed system is suitable to support clinicians to reliably drive and evaluate clinical interventions toward quality of life improvement of people with cognitive impairment. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

There has been less attention given to isolation in senior housing communities. The objectives of this pilot study were to test two methods to identify socially isolated residents in low-income senior housing and compare findings about the extent of isolation from these two methods. The first method, self-report by residents, included 47 out of 135 residents who completed in-person interviews. To determine self-report isolation, residents completed the Lubben Social Network Scale 6 (LSNS-6). The second method involved a staff member who reported the extent of isolation on all 135 residents via an online survey. Results indicated that 26% of residents who were interviewed were deemed socially isolated by the LSNS-6. Staff members rated 12% of residents as having some or a lot of isolation. In comparing the two methods, staff members rated 2% of interviewed residents as having a lot of isolation. The combination of self-report and staff report could be more informative than just self-report alone, particularly when participation rates are low.

2-s2.0-84929406561,Tech,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,good,neutral,good,"Thus , this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group .<q>The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred .<q>People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1 .","In recent years , ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults .

Mobile applications (apps) have been developed to facilitate CBT-I in the general population. However, because of deteriorating perceptual and cognitive functioning, the effectiveness of mobile apps in older adults remains unknown. Materials and Methods: This case report aims to demonstrate the utilization, advantages, and limitations of mobile app-assisted CBT-I in an older female adult. An app (""Win-Win aSleep"" [WWaS]) was applied in a six-session CBT-I treatment. Results: The patient successfully discontinued her hypnotics and had restored sleep quality after the intervention with WWaS-assisted CBT-I. Several limitations of WWaS were summarized, and pertinent approaches for enhancing future work were discussed. Conclusions: Mobile apps integrating wearable devices might overcome the difficulty for applying WWaS in older adults. In addition to tailored design of mobile technology for older adults, psychosocial support for the utilization of apps may not only enhance the compliance but also provide additional connection to the environment. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",medium,1216,169,neutral,neutral,neutral,"However , because of deteriorating perceptual and cognitive functioning , the effectiveness of mobile apps in older adults remains unknown .<q>Mobile applications ( apps ) have been developed to facilitate CBT-I in the general population .<q>An app ( `` Win-Win aSleep '' [ WWaS ] ) was applied in a six-session CBT-I treatment .","Introduction : Current evidence suggests potential efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia -LRB- CBT-I -RRB- in older adults .

2-s2.0-84929391390,Tech,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,neutral,neutral,neutral,"This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life .<q>In many cases , older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives , since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group .<q>A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design ( LBD ) has been introduced on these grounds3,4 .","In addition , it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2 .

This article describes a qualitative method for using case notes from the clinical records of older individuals in order to investigate the priority concerns spontaneously reported by older adults to deepen our understanding of both the context in which reported loneliness occurs in Ireland and the potential triggers. The participants in this study represent a cross-section of older adults who participated in the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic (TRIL). Data were collected from participants through interviewer case notes at the TRIL centre in St James's hospital, Dublin. 624 participants (431 females; 193 males) ranging in age from 60-92 years (Mean 73 years, SD 7 years) took part in the study. All were community dwelling and provided consent. A thematic analysis from grounded theory was used to evaluate the case notes for each participant. Preliminary results highlight the richness of phenomenological experience to enhance our understanding of loneliness and provide an opportunity to better understand the precursors and variability that loneliness may take. In this study we found themes in the case note analysis linking social loneliness with self-imposed limitations on social engagement due to declining health while predominate themes for emotionally lonely focused on psychological issues of stress and anxiety associated with adverse life events.

Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness.

2-s2.0-84921673606,Tech,Unobtrusive In-Home Detection of Time Spent Out-of-Home with Applications to Loneliness and Physical Activity,"Loneliness is a common condition in elderly associated with severe health consequences including increased mortality, decreased cognitive function, and poor quality of life. Identifying and assisting lonely individuals is therefore increasingly important - especially in the home setting - as the very nature of loneliness often makes it difficult to detect by traditional methods. One critical component in assessing loneliness unobtrusively is to measure time spent out-of-home, as loneliness often presents with decreased physical activity, decreased motor functioning, and a decline in activities of daily living, all of which may cause decrease in the amount of time spent outside the home. Using passive and unobtrusive in-home sensing technologies, we have developed a methodology for detecting time spent out-of-home based on logistic regression.

However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Tech,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",long,2272,356,neutral,neutral,good,"We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users .<q>The game is integrated into a custom social network , and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space .<q>Our user group selected one of the games they play together , Memory , a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience .","Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age .

2-s2.0-84878271438,Tech,The influence of the family on prevalence and morbidity of geriatric depression among elderly gopd attendees at UPTH,"The study was done to determine the influence of the family on the prevalence of geriatric depression among the General Outpatient Department of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) attendees. This was done against the background of the family being the most important influence on health and disease outcomes. Conversely, the family is the first to be affected when any member of the family falls ill. A descriptive cross-sectional study of one hundred and fifty randomly selected elderly patients attending the GOPD was carried out. A structured questionnaire containing the geriatric depression scale and the family questionnaire was administered to the patients that had satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data was entered into the computer using the Epi-Info Version 3.2.2 Software and analysed. Lack of family and social support, marital disharmony, parents living with their children and feeling of not mattering by the elderly were among the family attributes that were associated with depression. Living alone was not a risk factor. It was also found that the family had a significant role to play in the prevalence and morbidity of depression in the respondents. Likewise, the care of depressed patients took a toll on the family caregivers making them react adversely thereby worsening the condition of the recipients of care. © Medwell Journals, 2013.",medium,1396,217,good,neutral,good,"The study was done to determine the influence of the family on the prevalence of geriatric depression among the General Outpatient Department of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital ( UPTH ) attendees .<q>Lack of family and social support , marital disharmony , parents living with their children and feeling of not mattering by the elderly were among the family attributes that were associated with depression .<q>Living alone was not a risk factor .","Conversely , the family is the first to be affected when any member of the family falls ill .

2-s2.0-84887957045,Tech,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,neutral,neutral,bad,"The service development focused on three categories of services : cognitive activities , social activities , and physical activities .<q>Loneliness and social isolation can , however , be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services .<q>Objective : This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly , and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them .","Background : There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today .

Method: To determine the effectiveness of the experiment in terms of reducing loneliness, 15 older adults were interviewed three times: shortly before the start, two years later and immediately after termination of the experiment, while their loneliness scores at zero and post-measurement were compared with those of a control group. Results: Both the participants and the control persons experienced a reduction in loneliness over time. However, the reduction was only significant for the intervention participants. Moreover, the changes in loneliness were significantly greater among the participants compared to the control persons. When looking more in detail, the effect of the experiment was only significant regarding emotional loneliness and among the highest educated. Findings of the qualitative research enabled us to understand the mechanisms through which the intervention helped alleviate loneliness. E-mail was found to facilitate social contact. Furthermore, the computer and Internet were often used to pass the time, taking people's minds off their loneliness. Unexpectedly, the intervention also improved people's self-confidence.

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies.

Design and Methods: After receiving signed informed consent from each participant, we randomly assigned 66 caregivers to an Internet-based intervention or to a no-intervention control group. The intervention group received computers and training in order to access a password-protected Web site with links to information, e-mail, and threaded discussion. Unique to the Web site was a video-conferencing link that supported caregivers' participation in a 10-session, manual-guided psychosocial support group, followed by 12 additional online sessions facilitated by a group member. Participants completed health-status and stress-response measures at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Results: Content analysis of archived video sessions showed (a) reliable adherence to the manual-guided support-group intervention and (b) online group discussion themes similar to those in face-to-face caregiver support groups. Analyses of stress-response outcome data showed significant between-group differences, with the intervention group experiencing a decline in stress compared with an escalation in stress for the control group. Implications: Despite the limitations of this pilot study in terms of limited sample size and 54% dropout of control participants at 6-month follow-up, the results provide preliminary supportive evidence for a technology-based psychosocial intervention for family caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative disease.

2-s2.0-84880120348,Tech,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported.

At times these two discourses created tension for home visitors. Examining how the home visiting service is described by the service organisation online explains these tensions. The online materials construct active older volunteers as providing professional services while those they visit are constructed as receiving friendship. These discourses provide different ageing identities for visitors from those they visit, which contributes to the difficulties in navigating home visiting services.

2-s2.0-84878728077,Tech,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income.

2-s2.0-85044390759,Tech,Comparing daily drivers of problem drinking among older and younger adults: An electronic daily diary study using smartphones,"Background: By 2030, numbers and proportions of older adults with substance-use problems are expected to increase. While risk factors for problem drinking in late life have been identified, it remains unknown whether these factors drive daily drinking among older problem drinkers. This study examined the daily drivers of drinking among problem drinkers, moderated by age, utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Method: Participants (N = 139), ages 20–73, received daily EMA online surveys completed via a smartphone prior to initiation of treatment. Multilevel modeling tested the moderating impact of age on within- and between-person relationships between drinking and focal predictors (mood, loneliness, boredom, stress, poor sleep, social factors, alcohol salience, commitment and confidence not to drink heavily). Results: Older adults reported greater alcohol consumption when daily boredom levels were higher. Heavier drinking among younger adults was associated with poorer sleep quality. Greater daily confidence, daily commitment and daily alcohol salience did not impact drinking to the same extent for older adults as for younger adults. Greater person-level commitment predicted reduced drinking equivalently across age, but low person-level commitment predicted greater drinking among older adults compared to their younger counterparts. Conclusion: Older adults may have unique daily drivers of drinking that are not fully realized in current research and intervention efforts. Addressing the growing substance-use treatment needs among this population will require identifying the unique drivers of drinking among older adults, such as boredom, when compared to younger adults. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",medium,1726,241,good,neutral,bad,"This study examined the daily drivers of drinking among problem drinkers , moderated by age , utilizing ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) .<q>Background : By 2030 , numbers and proportions of older adults with substance-use problems are expected to increase .<q>Results : Older adults reported greater alcohol consumption when daily boredom levels were higher .","Background : By 2030 , numbers and proportions of older adults with substance-use problems are expected to increase .

2-s2.0-84877312145,Tech,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

This study examined the efficacy of learning and using an online social networking website, Facebook.com, as an intervention to maintain or enhance cognitive function in older adults. Method: Forty-one older adults were assigned to learn and use Facebook (n = 14) or an online diary website (active control, n = 13) for 8 weeks or placed on a waitlist (n = 14). Outcome measures included neuropsychological tests of executive functions, memory, and processing speed and self-report questionnaires about social engagement. Results: The Facebook group showed a significant increase in a composite measure of updating, an executive function factor associated with complex working memory tasks, compared to no significant change in the control groups. Other measures of cognitive function and social support showed no differential improvement in the Facebook group. Discussion: Learning and using an online social networking site may provide specific benefits for complex working memory in a group of healthy older adults. This may reflect the particular cognitive demands associated with online social networking and/or the benefits of social engagement more generally. © The Author 2016.

2-s2.0-85028289846,Tech,Information and communication technology use is related to higher well-being among the oldest-old,"Objectives: Older adults often prioritize socially meaningful goals over informational goals. Thus, we predicted that using information and communication technology (ICT) in service of socially meaningful versus informational goals relates to higher well-being among the oldest-old. Method: We surveyed 445 adults aged 80+ (mean = 84, range = 80–93; 64% female; 26% non-White) online or via telephone. Participants reported motivations for ICT use (connect with others, learn new information) and rated their psychological and physical well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, loneliness, goal attainment, subjective health, functional limitations). We conducted regression and mediation analyses to test our hypothesis. Results: Participants used ICT more to connect with friends/family (M = 3.66, SD = 1.28) than to learn information (M = 2.61, SD = 1.44), p < .001. Overall, ICT use predicted higher well-being across outcomes, ps ≤ .008. Motivations for use differentially mediated these effects: Social motivations mediated the relationships between ICT use and psychological well-being, whereas informational motivations mediated the relationships between ICT use and physical well-being. Discussion: Older adults aged 80+ use ICT less than other generations, but may have much to gain. Using social versus informational technologies may enhance multiple aspects of well-being in different ways during very late life.

Exploring perceived benefits and challenges with web-based information and communication technologies as a means of supporting working carers' in their caregiving role, this paper draws on findings from a qualitative study. The study aimed to describe working carers' experiences of having access to the web-based family care support network ‘A good place' (AGP) provided by the municipality to support those caring for an older family member. Content analysis of interviews with nine working carers revealed three themes: A support hub, connections to peers, personnel and knowledge; Experiencing ICT support as relevant in changing life circumstances; and Upholding one's personal firewall. Findings indicate that the web-based family care support network AGP is an accessible, complementary means of support. Utilising support while balancing caregiving, work obligations and responsibilities was made easier with access to AGP; enabling working carers to access information, psychosocial support and learning opportunities. In particular, it provided channels for carers to share experiences with others, to be informed, and to gain insights into medical and care issues. This reinforced working carers' sense of competence, helping them meet caregiving demands and see positive aspects in their situation. Carers' low levels of digital skills and anxieties about using computer-based support were barriers to utilising web-based support and could lead to deprioritising of this support. However, to help carers overcome these barriers and to better match web-based support to working carers' preferences and situations, web-based support must be introduced in a timely manner and must more accurately meet each working carer's unique caregiving needs. © 2016 Nordic College of Caring Science",medium,2015,292,neutral,good,good,"Findings indicate that the web-based family care support network AGP is an accessible , complementary means of support .<q>Policy makers in Sweden and other European Member States pay increasing attention as to how best support working carers ; carers juggling providing unpaid family care for older family members while performing paid work .<q>Exploring perceived benefits and challenges with web-based information and communication technologies as a means of supporting working carers ' in their caregiving role , this paper draws on findings from a qualitative study .","The study aimed to describe working carers ' experiences of having access to the web-based family care support network ` A good place ' -LRB- AGP -RRB- provided by the municipality to support those caring for an older family member .

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found.

In this context, a survey has been conducted to assess nurses and caregivers’ palliative care training, needs and expectations. Methods An anonymous survey has been conducted in June 2015, including the nurses and all the caregivers of a 379-bed residential facility for the elderly requiring full time care and geriatric long time care unit. Dr-Chastaingt hospital is a public institution attached to Limoges university hospital (France). A questionnaire was addressed to review the local palliative context, the needs of heathcare personnels and their expectations. Results and discussion Ninety-four questionnaires were returned, with four white sheets and 90 filled forms. The main reasons for seeking advice from the palliative care team are the patient and his pain and caregivers suffering and at the third place family support. Pain management and end of life remain the main expectations of caregivers both for technical assistance, training and support. These results show a questioning on the end of life, a need for modeling in order to identify the tipping point between healing and terminal care. They also show the need to build a common space for dialogue between physicians, nurses, caregivers, patient and family in order to act together instead of interacting on a confrontational or suspicious way. The cooperation with the palliative care team is described both by the form and mode. The cooperation is based on meetings and practical cooperation (care, prescriptions, visits). Pain and autonomy assessments are regular but not systematic in geriatrics. The palliative care team trigger tools are not known (Pallia-10, Palliative Performans Scale).

2-s2.0-84865446863,Tech,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

For careand technology professionals working with older persons it is important to know how to facilitate the use of technology by older persons. This paper presents the translation of the results of a field study into multilevel and multidisciplinary educational material. Method: During home visits, community-dwelling seniors were interviewed regarding reasons for their level of technology use. All types of technology that could support activities of daily living, were included. Resulting themes formed the basis of the development of personas and scripts for education. Next, lecturers from vocational and higher technical and care education developed an evidence-based educational module from the perspective of professional service provision. Results: 53 older adults were interviewed. The level of technology use is influenced by six themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioural options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organisations; and the role of the physical environment. Four personas were developed, one of which was featured into a film, with twelve separate scenes.

2-s2.0-84865506640,Tech,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

The burden of dementia care often falls on the family members, entailing heavy psychosocial and economic consequences. The aim of this study was to evaluate the caregiver's perspective concerning the support for disease management on behalf of the physicians and the local Sicilian administrations (Italy), and the burden of care and effects on their lifestyle, to propose new prevention strategies and service for managing dementia and caregiver's burden. Fifty-nine caregivers of Italian elderly people with dementia (mean age, 73; age range: 63-83) were interviewed, and 55 of them completed an ad hoc self-report questionnaire composed of 54 multiple-choice questions. Our findings suggest that caregivers need more information on the disease's management, as well as on how to deal with the stress due to the disease burden. Moreover, a negative perception about the services offered from the local administration emerged. Assistive technology (AT) could be useful in promoting interaction between general practitioners and specialized centers for diagnosis, pharmacological and psychosocial treatments, and in saving costs. Moreover, case manager could follow patients and support family members within the care pathway, besides collecting and sharing information among the different health professionals involved.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Tech,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,good,neutral,good,"The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults .<q>Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function , but they have not been well characterized .<q>Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 ( 8.2 , 9.2 ) seconds and expended 6,976 ( 6,669 , 7,284 ) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity .","Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living , and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function .

2-s2.0-84862164688,Tech,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment.

The innovative applications developed in this research project could have wide application for a large number of older adults living alone. Method: We used a web-based social network platform, enhanced with devices to detect users' states and collect activity data. The effectiveness of the ICT-based solution was assessed throughout the project with user and control groups in Spain, Sweden and Greece. User interviews and psychological testing were conducted at the beginning of the project and after a year of deployment of the equipment. Both groups completed the same assessment protocol. Results & discussion: We found that only the user group showed an improvement from pretest to posttest in the affective dimension of the wellbeing SPF-IL scale. This dimension relates to the degree of confidence, social acceptance, and level of satisfaction with the people around them. Exploring new ways to maintain the cognitive and functional state of older users is today a critical issue, for individuals, their families, and for whole societies.

2-s2.0-26444489161,Tech,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses.

Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-85040464379,Tech,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

Twenty semistructured, openended interviews were conducted in February 2005 to collect data. Grounded theory was used to guide data analysis. Major findings include the following: First, within this particular group of older American Internet users, there is little online interaction. The Internet is used primarily as a handy tool to obtain information rather than for developing online relationships. Second, weak tie relationships that develop as a result of face-to-face interactions in computer club meetings facilitate the exchange of information among members. Third, social interactions in the offline environment also provide rich opportunities for older adults to form and maintain companionship relationships.

We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,good,neutral,neutral,"We aimed to assess feasibility , reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care .<q>Compared to local UK Census data on older people , participants were younger , more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected .<q>Background : With population ageing , research is needed into new low-cost , scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people .","Background : With population ageing , research is needed into new low-cost , scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people .

2-s2.0-84959193555,Tech,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Tech,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,good,neutral,good,"Objective : The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy ( ehealth literacy ) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users .<q>Nonetheless , research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments , in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself .<q>Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine : ( 1 ) the construct validity of the e-HLS and ( 2 ) its association with respondents ' demographic characteristics and health variables .","With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information , including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps , electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research .

2-s2.0-84959018208,Tech,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible.

2-s2.0-84928566433,Tech,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences.

2-s2.0-84951961928,Tech,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,good,neutral,neutral,"To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids .<q>The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users .<q>For these cases , there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency .","Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss .

2-s2.0-84897635686,Tech,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

2-s2.0-84929417715,Tech,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,neutral,suboptimal,bad,"It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults .<q>Method : In 2013 , twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone .<q>To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences , Singtel , a local telecommunication company , has initiated a project called Silverline .","To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences , Singtel , a local telecommunication company , has initiated a project called Silverline .

2-s2.0-84921647901,Tech,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,neutral,neutral,neutral,"The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline .<q>We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors .<q>Thus , these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness , increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends , including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement ( Páscoa , 2012 ) .","In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new , the different and the snapshot , we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals .

2-s2.0-84903454175,Tech,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments.

2-s2.0-84929406209,Tech,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy.

2-s2.0-84929411059,Tech,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,neutral,neutral,neutral,"The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China 's communities1 today .<q>Method : First , reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors .<q>Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement .","Purpose : A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China .

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,neutral,neutral,good,Setting : Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes .<q>Conclusion : The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care .<q>Researchers tested the BEAM 's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument 's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors .,"Design : Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns -LRB- SMILE -RRB- Study .

2-s2.0-84880582014,Tech,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform.

We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04).

The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs.
