2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.",long,3062,449,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508188789\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older."",""1"",729,180]]",1,True,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,yes,1,27.421,783,1679,bad,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,no,0,43.18899999999999,783,1679,good,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175950108\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge"",""1"",1068,161]]",0,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,yes,1,36.985,783,1679,bad,1
2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013.

2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,yes,1,14.475999999999999,783,1679,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175975747\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games"",""1"",2350,122]]",1,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,yes,1,9.222999999999999,783,1679,good,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460602845\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets."",""1"",355,179],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460612084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general."",""3"",128,77]]",0,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,yes,1,7.775,783,1679,good,1
2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458619534\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults."",""1"",382,176]]",0,True,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,no,0,15.275,783,1679,good,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183585707\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The proposed approach is the acquisition of the \""memory\"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home"",""1"",1166,125]]",0,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,no,0,12.418,783,1679,bad,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183703064\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors"",""1"",453,120]]",0,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,no,0,28.61,783,1679,good,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion.

2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541185379733\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan."",""1"",633,468]]",0,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,yes,1,56.099,783,1679,good,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176150652\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users.

2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183351163\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults.

2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall.

2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541184922051\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1)"",""1"",668,205]]",0,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,no,0,59.803999999999995,783,1679,good,1
2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176243007\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs.

2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,yes,1,36.453,783,1679,good,1

The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541182900509\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan.

2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459388260\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia."",""1"",977,80]]",0,False,a3b6cdf027031c3f789f89e2fe273fc799efbf82,SRB,no,0,11.744000000000002,783,1679,bad,1
2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176309396\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids.

2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458619534\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults."",""1"",382,176]]",0,True,da205251da145a7860a61ba501888ffa127ebe8c,TUR,no,0,10.700999999999999,969,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,da205251da145a7860a61ba501888ffa127ebe8c,TUR,yes,1,21.552,969,1903,good,1

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014).

2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,da205251da145a7860a61ba501888ffa127ebe8c,TUR,no,0,8.862,969,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,base,,0,True,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,no,0,30.014,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,no,0,93.494,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,base,,0,True,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,yes,1,12.772,1184,2114,,1

Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants.

Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,base,,0,False,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,no,0,21.701,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,base,,1,False,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,no,0,19.288,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,base,,1,False,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,no,0,36.903,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,base,,1,False,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,no,0,60.379,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,base,,0,False,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,yes,1,8.597999999999999,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,3,base,,1,True,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,no,0,17.724,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,3,base,,0,False,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,yes,1,24.487,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,3,base,,0,False,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,no,0,86.60700000000001,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,3,base,,1,False,a965a9f51331c214016a8722c27f2e397e8af29e,SRB,maybe,1,17.497,1184,2114,,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,169.015,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,yes,1,13.77,518,360,,1

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014). Regular or irregular club's activity attending was not related with mental status and quality of life. The majority of the sample had equal or better mental health status and quality of life compared with the general population. The prevalence of depression was slightly lower than other Thai studies.",long,2432,368,1349655,1,base,,0,True,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,15.757,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,base,,1,True,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,yes,1,26.469,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,2,base,,0,True,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,9.046,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall. Using mobile devices to collect data from and monitor older adult patients has the potential to improve detection of changes in their health.",long,2175,325,1349655,2,base,,0,False,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,6.405,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,2,base,,0,False,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,7.35,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,2,base,,0,False,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,23.639,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,3,base,,0,True,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,7.632000000000001,518,360,,1

The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies.

Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,3,base,,1,False,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,yes,1,14.07,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support. Further research into online peer support for carers of people with dementia is needed to clarify who benefits under what conditions.",long,2243,325,1349655,3,base,,1,False,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,17.012,518,360,,1

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,3,base,,0,False,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,14.414000000000001,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,3,base,,0,False,d4832fd32e8d057c59f6b8f1aee4a2622d97f327,BIH,no,0,31.763,518,360,,1
2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183688329\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""merging ICT technology"",""1"",23,22],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183692249\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""by older people"",""3"",43,15],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183698377\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Life-Based Design "",""5"",1263,18],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183702810\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""QoL"",""7"",592,3],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183708859\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes"",""9"",262,65],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183716667\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Fit-for-life analysis"",""11"",110,21]]",0,True,b9b7003b527116255e81d52df7664eb90aaf3c55,SWE,no,0,251.11,937,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,b9b7003b527116255e81d52df7664eb90aaf3c55,SWE,no,0,5.232,937,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,b9b7003b527116255e81d52df7664eb90aaf3c55,SWE,yes,1,10.407,937,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,base,,1,True,e322a2edbe81cb8ceefa6ff8aac8bec30986bc89,ROU,yes,1,16.826,710,923,,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. Contacting family is likely to be the best ""selling point"" of the Internet for older people.",long,2860,443,1349655,1,base,,1,True,e322a2edbe81cb8ceefa6ff8aac8bec30986bc89,ROU,yes,1,4.562,710,923,,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,base,,1,True,e322a2edbe81cb8ceefa6ff8aac8bec30986bc89,ROU,yes,1,10.436,710,923,,1

Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%).

However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions.

In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,dcc544c9c2fd9d3049e36997c854c7a0b023a205,VEN,yes,1,10.156,590,604,good,1

A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501109312\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent."",""1"",13,126]]",1,True,dcc544c9c2fd9d3049e36997c854c7a0b023a205,VEN,yes,1,7.185,590,604,bad,1

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176089080\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function"",""1"",25,220]]",0,True,6bfe10c170d810065eb7906eae4ab83ddca6a2d9,BIH,no,0,70.421,789,1423,bad,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459925749\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner."",""1"",511,370]]",1,True,6bfe10c170d810065eb7906eae4ab83ddca6a2d9,BIH,yes,1,28.763,789,1423,good,1

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,6bfe10c170d810065eb7906eae4ab83ddca6a2d9,BIH,yes,1,8.863999999999999,789,1423,good,1
2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541185142364\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan"",""1"",13,195]]",1,False,6bfe10c170d810065eb7906eae4ab83ddca6a2d9,BIH,yes,1,17.604,789,1423,good,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support. Further research into online peer support for carers of people with dementia is needed to clarify who benefits under what conditions.",long,2243,325,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176732290\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183536433\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objectives of the current research were (1) to test and evaluate the investigator-designed Behavior, Engagement, and Affect Measure (BEAM) touchpad direct observational data collection tool, and (2) to implement this tool to investigate residents' patterns of behavioral agitation, engagement, affect, behaviors associated with positive mood, general time-activity use, and social interactions within long-term care.

2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176309396\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids.

2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,no,0,42.413999999999994,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,base,,0,True,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,no,0,74.704,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,no,0,14.439,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,base,,1,True,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,yes,1,15.752,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,base,,0,True,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,no,0,28.4,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology.

2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",long,2272,356,1349655,2,base,,1,False,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,no,0,15.892999999999999,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,2,base,,0,False,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,no,0,12.377,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,2,base,,0,False,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,no,0,12.385,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.",long,2411,353,1349655,2,base,,1,False,cf361fdd39be571ae2dda17e42c491706c379abc,SRB,maybe,1,25.471,852,1730,,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,8fa6c34bed932ea20e1f6673b2c11829408ba8f5,VNM,yes,1,172.562,753,1424,good,1

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014).

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459925749\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner."",""1"",511,370]]",1,True,8fa6c34bed932ea20e1f6673b2c11829408ba8f5,VNM,yes,1,1.6480000000000001,753,1424,good,1
2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,8fa6c34bed932ea20e1f6673b2c11829408ba8f5,VNM,yes,1,15.216,753,1424,good,1
2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,8fa6c34bed932ea20e1f6673b2c11829408ba8f5,VNM,yes,1,16.326,753,1424,good,1
2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,base,,0,True,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,no,0,16.505,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.",long,3062,449,1349655,1,base,,1,True,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,yes,1,8.557,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,base,,0,True,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,no,0,26.802,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. Contacting family is likely to be the best ""selling point"" of the Internet for older people.",long,2860,443,1349655,1,base,,1,True,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,yes,1,31.16,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,no,0,24.891,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,2,base,,1,True,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,yes,1,16.192999999999998,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,base,,0,False,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,no,0,34.98,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,base,,1,False,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,yes,1,12.737,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,base,,1,False,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,no,0,10.218,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,base,,1,False,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,yes,1,7.702000000000001,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,base,,0,False,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,yes,1,11.22,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,3,base,,0,True,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,no,0,10.917,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,base,,0,False,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,yes,1,18.475,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,base,,0,False,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,no,0,19.275,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.",long,2411,353,1349655,3,base,,1,False,3ce88d297f144db2b27909dcfe4972f4529a7b99,COL,no,0,28.537,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,b5b44b027e4684ce0cb32820ffe270a16f85f1f7,VEN,no,0,49.698,657,1349,,1

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,b5b44b027e4684ce0cb32820ffe270a16f85f1f7,VEN,yes,1,39.400999999999996,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,base,,0,True,b5b44b027e4684ce0cb32820ffe270a16f85f1f7,VEN,yes,1,46.326,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,base,,1,True,b5b44b027e4684ce0cb32820ffe270a16f85f1f7,VEN,yes,1,72.49600000000001,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,base,,1,True,b5b44b027e4684ce0cb32820ffe270a16f85f1f7,VEN,yes,1,22.686999999999998,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,b5b44b027e4684ce0cb32820ffe270a16f85f1f7,VEN,yes,1,236.737,657,1349,,1

Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,90f2ce188e8016c1bc850fa2c6186a43c34ce885,POL,no,0,13.24,835,1343,good,1

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022).

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information.

Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,45.091,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,yes,1,5.971,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501070698\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control."",""1"",723,82],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501031791\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform"",""3"",179,102],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501040859\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list."",""5"",45,89]]",1,True,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,yes,1,5.803,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175865171\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey"",""1"",398,141],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175875491\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge."",""3"",262,266],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175888458\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541167669350\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones."",""1"",2379,213]]",1,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,2.73,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,4.8180000000000005,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends).

2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460602845\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets."",""1"",355,179],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460612084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general."",""3"",128,77]]",0,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,6.192,657,1349,good,1

This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499867213\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Online"",""1"",326,6],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499877880\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients"",""3"",1744,98]]",0,True,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,2.481,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541165757323\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information."",""1"",1492,260]]",0,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,6.871,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183703064\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors"",""1"",453,120]]",0,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,3.116,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183787993\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, "",""1"",662,165]]",0,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,2.21,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176150652\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users.

2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541167511013\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables."",""1"",508,208]]",1,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,1.3359999999999999,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. Contacting family is likely to be the best ""selling point"" of the Internet for older people.",long,2860,443,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541500261229\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits"",""1"",982,89]]",1,True,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,1.651,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall.

2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183395961\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness.

2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176682436\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care."",""1"",169,150]]",0,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,1.137,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,2.52,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183856597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life."",""1"",210,251]]",1,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,1.903,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459388260\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia."",""1"",977,80]]",0,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,2.387,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175809634\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids"",""1"",388,109]]",0,False,7ec36c83db3ce6903bd0b467605fa87e7ea4212b,TUR,no,0,3.2039999999999997,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people.

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,f69fbf141dacb613b254bc362321907071486a43,RUS,no,0,100.941,866,1895,good,1
2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,f69fbf141dacb613b254bc362321907071486a43,RUS,no,0,7.582999999999999,866,1895,good,1
2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176699290\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team"",""1"",22,171]]",1,True,f69fbf141dacb613b254bc362321907071486a43,RUS,no,0,6.75,866,1895,bad,1
2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541167669350\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones."",""1"",2379,213]]",1,False,f69fbf141dacb613b254bc362321907071486a43,RUS,yes,1,9.23,866,1895,good,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,f69fbf141dacb613b254bc362321907071486a43,RUS,no,0,17.187,866,1895,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175975747\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games"",""1"",2350,122]]",1,False,f69fbf141dacb613b254bc362321907071486a43,RUS,yes,1,50.398,866,1895,good,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner.

(i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459925749\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner."",""1"",511,370]]",1,True,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,yes,1,7.796,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541182443521\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""he core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1).

2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,yes,1,27.747,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,5.25,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506026510\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Internet"",""1"",343,8],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506018804\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Internet users"",""3"",2048,14],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506014302\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""These findings have important implications for medical practice.

2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones.

2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,yes,1,8.184,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175959107\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone"",""1"",904,63],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175953443\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model "",""3"",363,52],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175939963\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures"",""5"",1459,228]]",1,False,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,4.294,658,1349,good,1

Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183493458\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol."",""1"",169,176]]",0,False,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,7.215,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183331141\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots',"",""1"",861,61]]",1,True,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,3.51,658,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541165757323\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information."",""1"",1492,260]]",0,False,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,6.8020000000000005,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183703064\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors"",""1"",453,120]]",0,False,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,5.779,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458490368\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses."",""1"",1870,127]]",0,False,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,5.482,658,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176150652\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users.

2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460700482\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet"",""1"",508,126],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460736724\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Respondents in Cluster 4, the \""social users,\"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites."",""3"",1198,153]]",1,False,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,yes,1,7.056,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,10.841,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall.

2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183395961\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness.

2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access.

2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,no,0,6.791,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183239367\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life"",""1"",364,96]]",1,False,7d5e833f621c0f84c4e841b9bd79f6095c621080,VEN,yes,1,2.7560000000000002,658,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183536433\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objectives of the current research were (1) to test and evaluate the investigator-designed Behavior, Engagement, and Affect Measure (BEAM) touchpad direct observational data collection tool, and (2) to implement this tool to investigate residents' patterns of behavioral agitation, engagement, affect, behaviors associated with positive mood, general time-activity use, and social interactions within long-term care.

2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176646713\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center.

2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183598079\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Physical function"",""1"",25,17],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183600697\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""older adults "",""3"",102,13],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183608545\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""physical and mental health-related"",""5"",287,34],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183621828\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" mental health-related factors"",""7"",1602,30]]",0,True,0e8988b8bd5a480bcf33082ea2d7e3af9a75abab,BIH,yes,1,6.809,627,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,0e8988b8bd5a480bcf33082ea2d7e3af9a75abab,BIH,yes,1,32.311,627,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460055850\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group.

2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183331141\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots',"",""1"",861,61]]",1,True,0e8988b8bd5a480bcf33082ea2d7e3af9a75abab,BIH,yes,1,25.455,627,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,6b336c1adef7185a8406beec59723d18e08d19e5,GRC,no,0,29.364,711,1264,good,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506026510\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Internet"",""1"",343,8],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506018804\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Internet users"",""3"",2048,14],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506014302\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""These findings have important implications for medical practice.

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014).

2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal.

2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183598079\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Physical function"",""1"",25,17],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183600697\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""older adults "",""3"",102,13],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183608545\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""physical and mental health-related"",""5"",287,34],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183621828\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" mental health-related factors"",""7"",1602,30]]",0,True,600287a216424e6b538e7f4c696869dd91039069,TUR,no,0,46.513999999999996,718,412,good,1

No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,600287a216424e6b538e7f4c696869dd91039069,TUR,no,0,70.559,718,412,good,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183688329\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""merging ICT technology"",""1"",23,22],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183692249\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""by older people"",""3"",43,15],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183698377\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Life-Based Design "",""5"",1263,18],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183702810\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""QoL"",""7"",592,3],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183708859\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes"",""9"",262,65],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183716667\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Fit-for-life analysis"",""11"",110,21]]",0,True,600287a216424e6b538e7f4c696869dd91039069,TUR,no,0,114.89399999999999,718,412,good,1
2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183228722\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183366148\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy.

2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460133627\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors.

2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,9d6dcebc595775226c23878b3f5655dd50dce411,UKR,yes,1,302.193,627,1303,,1
2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.",long,3062,449,1349655,1,base,,1,True,9d6dcebc595775226c23878b3f5655dd50dce411,UKR,yes,1,77.99600000000001,627,1303,,1
2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,base,,1,True,9d6dcebc595775226c23878b3f5655dd50dce411,UKR,yes,1,54.653,627,1303,,1
2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,base,,1,True,9d6dcebc595775226c23878b3f5655dd50dce411,UKR,yes,1,52.757,627,1303,,1
2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,base,,0,True,9d6dcebc595775226c23878b3f5655dd50dce411,UKR,yes,1,66.675,627,1303,,1
2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,9d6dcebc595775226c23878b3f5655dd50dce411,UKR,yes,1,72.717,627,1303,,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,83547778f3bc4656b2e7d9d159623a1e0b668a83,VEN,no,0,27.381999999999998,626,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods.

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found.

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,7ff4d2f8fdcedfaab280ea135063d9579d7652eb,VEN,no,0,29.563000000000002,689,1263,good,1

One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,7ff4d2f8fdcedfaab280ea135063d9579d7652eb,VEN,yes,1,41.708999999999996,689,1263,good,1

The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,74548eac3dbe9783c0cef1812318f3ae59e62bdc,UKR,yes,1,53.766999999999996,625,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,fde02e6c28f867040dca57ada1c08f42c939e6e7,UKR,no,0,60.711000000000006,969,1903,,1

2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,base,,0,True,fde02e6c28f867040dca57ada1c08f42c939e6e7,UKR,no,0,63.657,969,1903,,1
2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,base,,0,True,fde02e6c28f867040dca57ada1c08f42c939e6e7,UKR,no,0,1373.921,969,1903,,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459258758\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today.

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,86abcc7dd68c1005bcaf51b89f2bf836b6806c1f,EGY,yes,1,15.491,625,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,86abcc7dd68c1005bcaf51b89f2bf836b6806c1f,EGY,no,0,38.838,625,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,a4300c2a4b98db5db8dd89175c7f1c0645531f67,UKR,no,0,72.515,789,1423,good,1
2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,a4300c2a4b98db5db8dd89175c7f1c0645531f67,UKR,no,0,60.527,789,1423,good,1
2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,a4300c2a4b98db5db8dd89175c7f1c0645531f67,UKR,no,0,72.436,789,1423,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460188173\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions."",""1"",446,252]]",1,True,a4300c2a4b98db5db8dd89175c7f1c0645531f67,UKR,no,0,86.678,789,1423,good,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176089080\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function"",""1"",25,220]]",0,True,a4300c2a4b98db5db8dd89175c7f1c0645531f67,UKR,no,0,23.655,789,1423,bad,1
2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541182900509\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan.

2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183638147\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""conducted semistructured interviews"",""1"",510,35],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183656977\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""esearchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care.

2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176309396\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids.

2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541185379733\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan."",""1"",633,468]]",0,False,a4300c2a4b98db5db8dd89175c7f1c0645531f67,UKR,no,0,326.834,789,1423,good,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176208363\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Web-based forums, social networking websites"",""1"",711,44],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176204138\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" Web-based surveys"",""3"",730,18],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176226419\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""he AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model"",""5"",292,71]]",0,False,a4300c2a4b98db5db8dd89175c7f1c0645531f67,UKR,yes,1,57.481,789,1423,bad,1
2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541167511013\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables."",""1"",508,208]]",1,False,a4300c2a4b98db5db8dd89175c7f1c0645531f67,UKR,yes,1,28.381999999999998,789,1423,good,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508684292\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years."",""1"",504,92]]",0,True,443dfe9aea45fba61e71f11d869564a2a0134610,ECU,no,0,17.629,702,1511,bad,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,443dfe9aea45fba61e71f11d869564a2a0134610,ECU,yes,1,63.025,702,1511,good,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,443dfe9aea45fba61e71f11d869564a2a0134610,ECU,no,0,50.406000000000006,702,1511,good,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,628d948885b30492fbb1c7c0f1b1a99662160850,EGY,yes,1,6.689,928,1194,good,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459624682\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design.

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,628d948885b30492fbb1c7c0f1b1a99662160850,EGY,yes,1,24.403000000000002,928,1194,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183027426\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment"",""1"",1548,110]]",1,True,628d948885b30492fbb1c7c0f1b1a99662160850,EGY,no,0,14.53,928,1194,good,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,628d948885b30492fbb1c7c0f1b1a99662160850,EGY,yes,1,9.986,928,1194,good,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system.

2-s2.0-84884552264,"Mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of an elderly club in suburban Bangkok.","Evolution of medical technologies extent human life expectancy. The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014). Regular or irregular club's activity attending was not related with mental status and quality of life. The majority of the sample had equal or better mental health status and quality of life compared with the general population.

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server.

For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions.

2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183027426\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment"",""1"",1548,110]]",1,True,c035ff08eb0b7efe499fa8bd83fb9ee5a43305a4,SRB,yes,1,154.077,938,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,c035ff08eb0b7efe499fa8bd83fb9ee5a43305a4,SRB,no,0,96.21799999999999,938,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,15.640999999999998,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,10.390999999999998,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,2,base,,0,True,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,13.263,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,base,,0,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,2.6710000000000003,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",long,2272,356,1349655,2,base,,1,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,yes,1,3.5980000000000003,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,base,,1,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,yes,1,4.08,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,base,,1,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,yes,1,3.819,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,base,,0,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,yes,1,29.333000000000002,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,3,base,,0,True,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,40.143,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,base,,0,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,5.3660000000000005,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,3,base,,1,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,yes,1,2.9930000000000003,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,base,,0,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,3.886,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.",long,2411,353,1349655,3,base,,1,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,yes,1,2.263,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.",long,3062,449,1349655,4,base,,1,True,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,yes,1,2.423,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,4,base,,0,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,5.327000000000001,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,4,base,,0,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,no,0,7.232,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,4,base,,1,False,439660f9457216e6851c069f1d430bb2dbed4825,VEN,yes,1,4.5760000000000005,831,1791,,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,60963448c8009cd71194735ead745b5da5204898,VEN,yes,1,6.171,734,1511,good,1
2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,60963448c8009cd71194735ead745b5da5204898,VEN,no,0,21.833000000000002,734,1511,good,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,aae604d3d0cc138a2b2d0e938a0b703140787d8e,EGY,no,0,27.01,540,1196,,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,base,,0,True,aae604d3d0cc138a2b2d0e938a0b703140787d8e,EGY,yes,1,71.619,540,1196,,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,base,,0,True,aae604d3d0cc138a2b2d0e938a0b703140787d8e,EGY,no,0,15.365,540,1196,,1
2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,base,,1,True,aae604d3d0cc138a2b2d0e938a0b703140787d8e,EGY,yes,1,29.232,540,1196,,1
2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,2,base,,1,True,aae604d3d0cc138a2b2d0e938a0b703140787d8e,EGY,no,0,15.269,540,1196,,1
2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,2,base,,0,False,aae604d3d0cc138a2b2d0e938a0b703140787d8e,EGY,no,0,13.993,540,1196,,1

It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,2,base,,0,False,aae604d3d0cc138a2b2d0e938a0b703140787d8e,EGY,no,0,11.512,540,1196,,1
2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,2,base,,1,False,aae604d3d0cc138a2b2d0e938a0b703140787d8e,EGY,yes,1,32.695,540,1196,,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458619534\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults."",""1"",382,176]]",0,True,0a583b72dae32ae675cd5deb53b0355fac8c44f1,EGY,yes,1,7.731,569,1226,good,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459976593\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers"",""1"",22,127]]",1,True,0a583b72dae32ae675cd5deb53b0355fac8c44f1,EGY,yes,1,5.4670000000000005,569,1226,bad,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,base,,1,True,da1fbb7a7b6281e8adb3b25f7b37e1fae917d1c8,ITA,yes,1,83.39299999999999,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,base,,0,True,9cc43f0cbf500f679c6375f5aced1e7f3b7e82fb,VEN,no,0,110.4,730,1499,,1

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,9cc43f0cbf500f679c6375f5aced1e7f3b7e82fb,VEN,no,0,12.375,730,1499,,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,base,,0,False,9cc43f0cbf500f679c6375f5aced1e7f3b7e82fb,VEN,no,0,3.28,876,1799,,1
2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,base,,1,False,9cc43f0cbf500f679c6375f5aced1e7f3b7e82fb,VEN,no,0,2.9610000000000003,876,1799,,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,base,,1,False,9cc43f0cbf500f679c6375f5aced1e7f3b7e82fb,VEN,yes,1,2.374,876,1799,,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,base,,1,False,9cc43f0cbf500f679c6375f5aced1e7f3b7e82fb,VEN,yes,1,18.362000000000002,876,1799,,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,base,,0,False,9cc43f0cbf500f679c6375f5aced1e7f3b7e82fb,VEN,yes,1,3.1660000000000004,876,1799,,1
2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,fd8db7cf2b8a75bf79233ae252521c357f0ee855,UKR,yes,1,12.702,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,fd8db7cf2b8a75bf79233ae252521c357f0ee855,UKR,yes,1,5.825,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods.

2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,fd8db7cf2b8a75bf79233ae252521c357f0ee855,UKR,yes,1,8.623,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.",long,3062,449,1349655,1,base,,1,True,60ba34e0bbe6cfff517604532574d7234a92b81c,BIH,yes,1,35.629,876,1343,,1
2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,base,,1,True,60ba34e0bbe6cfff517604532574d7234a92b81c,BIH,yes,1,90.43299999999999,876,1343,,1
2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,base,,1,True,60ba34e0bbe6cfff517604532574d7234a92b81c,BIH,yes,1,40.704,876,1343,,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,base,,1,True,60ba34e0bbe6cfff517604532574d7234a92b81c,BIH,yes,1,41.617,876,1343,,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,base,,1,True,60ba34e0bbe6cfff517604532574d7234a92b81c,BIH,yes,1,41.983000000000004,876,1343,,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506838616\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adult"",""1"",22,95]]",0,True,e1820bd034ff4a88517a5c9a1f5d782bcda91d53,VEN,no,0,3.287,1042,2114,bad,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541182443521\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""he core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1).

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,e1820bd034ff4a88517a5c9a1f5d782bcda91d53,VEN,yes,1,10.577,1042,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,no,0,95.50399999999999,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,yes,1,61.215,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,base,,1,True,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,yes,1,159.358,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,base,,1,True,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,yes,1,319.49,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,base,,1,True,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,yes,1,103.295,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,2,base,,0,True,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,no,0,85.70100000000001,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04).

2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,2,base,,0,False,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,yes,1,71.589,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,2,base,,0,False,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,no,0,106.646,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,3,base,,1,False,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,yes,1,39.413000000000004,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,3,base,,0,False,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,no,0,17.725,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,3,base,,0,False,2e74d98c3d3cbc54d1fb6aac97b6197877458882,UKR,yes,1,53.155,663,1340,,1
2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,3b5d8fdabf1e2dbc5bb34d549354b7c71424989a,BIH,no,0,63.391999999999996,939,2024,,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,base,,0,True,3b5d8fdabf1e2dbc5bb34d549354b7c71424989a,BIH,yes,1,6.832999999999999,939,2024,,1
2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,base,,1,True,3b5d8fdabf1e2dbc5bb34d549354b7c71424989a,BIH,yes,1,106.946,939,2024,,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,bf5616ecb1cc595d82ae6fd21b0158d86593c0c4,BGD,no,0,16.529,1145,2279,good,1
2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,bf5616ecb1cc595d82ae6fd21b0158d86593c0c4,BGD,no,0,9.908999999999999,1145,2279,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460188173\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions."",""1"",446,252]]",1,True,bf5616ecb1cc595d82ae6fd21b0158d86593c0c4,BGD,yes,1,44.225,1145,2279,good,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,bf5616ecb1cc595d82ae6fd21b0158d86593c0c4,BGD,yes,1,5.966,1145,2279,good,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support. Further research into online peer support for carers of people with dementia is needed to clarify who benefits under what conditions.",long,2243,325,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176925737\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue.

2-s2.0-84903162147,"Computer-assisted direct observation of behavioral agitation, engagement, and affect in long-term care residents","Objectives: The objectives of the current research were (1) to test and evaluate the investigator-designed Behavior, Engagement, and Affect Measure (BEAM) touchpad direct observational data collection tool, and (2) to implement this tool to investigate residents' patterns of behavioral agitation, engagement, affect, behaviors associated with positive mood, general time-activity use, and social interactions within long-term care. Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183414494\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objectives: The objectives of the current research were (1) to test and evaluate the investigator-designed Behavior, Engagement, and Affect Measure (BEAM) touchpad direct observational data collection tool, and (2) to implement this tool to investigate residents' patterns of behavioral agitation, engagement, affect, behaviors associated with positive mood, general time-activity use, and social interactions within long-term care.

2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176309396\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids.

2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176682436\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care."",""1"",169,150]]",0,False,bf5616ecb1cc595d82ae6fd21b0158d86593c0c4,BGD,no,0,4.923,1145,2279,good,1
2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,bf5616ecb1cc595d82ae6fd21b0158d86593c0c4,BGD,no,0,29.608,1145,2279,good,1
2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458667035\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050."",""1"",624,165]]",1,False,bf5616ecb1cc595d82ae6fd21b0158d86593c0c4,BGD,yes,1,36.823,1145,2279,bad,1

We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04).

2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541184922051\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1)"",""1"",668,205]]",0,False,bf5616ecb1cc595d82ae6fd21b0158d86593c0c4,BGD,no,0,15.777999999999999,1145,2279,good,1
2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508684292\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years."",""1"",504,92]]",0,True,03b230b7740c6be41da358cbe0dd34b32e6111a0,VEN,no,0,263.642,909,1263,bad,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183027426\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment"",""1"",1548,110]]",1,True,03b230b7740c6be41da358cbe0dd34b32e6111a0,VEN,yes,1,9.746,909,1263,good,1
2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,03b230b7740c6be41da358cbe0dd34b32e6111a0,VEN,yes,1,53.416000000000004,909,1263,good,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,2e4fa894744556e65825ba449b61cd992491f99c,VEN,yes,1,16.145,626,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,2e4fa894744556e65825ba449b61cd992491f99c,VEN,no,0,87.36399999999999,626,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175865171\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey"",""1"",398,141],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175875491\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge."",""3"",262,266],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175888458\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183582653\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends"",""1"",1569,181]]",1,False,2e4fa894744556e65825ba449b61cd992491f99c,VEN,yes,1,67.15100000000001,626,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,2e4fa894744556e65825ba449b61cd992491f99c,VEN,no,0,52.408,626,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends).

2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460602845\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets."",""1"",355,179],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460612084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general."",""3"",128,77]]",0,False,2e4fa894744556e65825ba449b61cd992491f99c,VEN,no,0,24.141,626,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,6474679f224b24327863122a70e89e592bde6fb4,TUR,yes,1,2.059,1011,2111,good,1
2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541178375946\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner"",""1"",719,161]]",1,True,6474679f224b24327863122a70e89e592bde6fb4,TUR,yes,1,6.297000000000001,1011,2111,good,1
2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459976593\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers"",""1"",22,127]]",1,True,6474679f224b24327863122a70e89e592bde6fb4,TUR,yes,1,1.695,1011,2111,bad,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183027426\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment"",""1"",1548,110]]",1,True,6474679f224b24327863122a70e89e592bde6fb4,TUR,yes,1,1.538,1011,2111,good,1
2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,6474679f224b24327863122a70e89e592bde6fb4,TUR,yes,1,1.601,1011,2111,good,1

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,dd9c7a8df28117a6fd66b72cfd5fd44fb0e4af83,EGY,no,0,190.50799999999998,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,dd9c7a8df28117a6fd66b72cfd5fd44fb0e4af83,EGY,no,0,29.976,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459925749\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner."",""1"",511,370]]",1,True,dd9c7a8df28117a6fd66b72cfd5fd44fb0e4af83,EGY,no,0,20.679000000000002,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499867213\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Online"",""1"",326,6],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499877880\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients"",""3"",1744,98]]",0,True,dd9c7a8df28117a6fd66b72cfd5fd44fb0e4af83,EGY,no,0,46.386,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,15a03946e6bbf0b39ff4d9fd67bae40823ca43e9,TUR,yes,1,20.041,1173,2379,,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014). Regular or irregular club's activity attending was not related with mental status and quality of life.

2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,base,,1,True,15a03946e6bbf0b39ff4d9fd67bae40823ca43e9,TUR,yes,1,26.375,1173,2379,,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,base,,1,True,15a03946e6bbf0b39ff4d9fd67bae40823ca43e9,TUR,yes,1,35.792,1173,2379,,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",long,2272,356,1349655,2,base,,1,False,15a03946e6bbf0b39ff4d9fd67bae40823ca43e9,TUR,yes,1,43.44,1173,2379,,1
2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,2,base,,0,False,15a03946e6bbf0b39ff4d9fd67bae40823ca43e9,TUR,yes,1,47.145,1173,2379,,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,2,base,,0,False,15a03946e6bbf0b39ff4d9fd67bae40823ca43e9,TUR,maybe,1,74.008,1173,2379,,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.",long,2411,353,1349655,2,base,,1,False,15a03946e6bbf0b39ff4d9fd67bae40823ca43e9,TUR,no,0,63.661,1173,2379,,1
2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458619534\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults."",""1"",382,176]]",0,True,0d214d7e26f42beaf1c92eaa0bc98891f93b684a,VEN,no,0,30.654,625,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459925749\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner."",""1"",511,370]]",1,True,0d214d7e26f42beaf1c92eaa0bc98891f93b684a,VEN,yes,1,20.410999999999998,625,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users. Computer/Internet training for older adults and computer/Internet use for various purposes need to consider the significant role their social capital can play.",long,3062,449,1349655,1,base,,1,True,12e33880bae1b64a279de91f00ae810b771f6d56,TUR,yes,1,41.916000000000004,626,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,base,,0,True,12e33880bae1b64a279de91f00ae810b771f6d56,TUR,no,0,44.144,626,1349,,1

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014). Regular or irregular club's activity attending was not related with mental status and quality of life.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,base,,1,True,12e33880bae1b64a279de91f00ae810b771f6d56,TUR,yes,1,23.221,626,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,base,,1,True,12e33880bae1b64a279de91f00ae810b771f6d56,TUR,yes,1,95.18299999999999,626,1349,,1

The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,2,base,,0,False,12e33880bae1b64a279de91f00ae810b771f6d56,TUR,no,0,55.063,626,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,2,base,,0,False,12e33880bae1b64a279de91f00ae810b771f6d56,TUR,yes,1,4.355,626,1349,,1
2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,2,base,,1,False,12e33880bae1b64a279de91f00ae810b771f6d56,TUR,yes,1,13.209000000000001,626,1349,,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183688329\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""merging ICT technology"",""1"",23,22],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183692249\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""by older people"",""3"",43,15],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183698377\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Life-Based Design "",""5"",1263,18],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183702810\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""QoL"",""7"",592,3],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183708859\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes"",""9"",262,65],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183716667\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Fit-for-life analysis"",""11"",110,21]]",0,True,b666bef70ef978c4572deac6579bf736d7b9838b,MNE,yes,1,8.012,969,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459976593\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers"",""1"",22,127]]",1,True,b666bef70ef978c4572deac6579bf736d7b9838b,MNE,yes,1,5.196000000000001,969,1903,bad,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,b666bef70ef978c4572deac6579bf736d7b9838b,MNE,yes,1,7.605,969,1903,good,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user.

2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541182443521\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""he core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1).

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,yes,1,3.6830000000000003,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,no,0,9.766,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541167669350\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones."",""1"",2379,213]]",1,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,yes,1,3.5789999999999997,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,yes,1,5.006,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460229865\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded."",""1"",1835,115]]",1,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,no,0,3.9130000000000003,1077,2114,bad,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183493458\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol."",""1"",169,176]]",0,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,yes,1,5.122000000000001,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,no,0,2.736,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183585707\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The proposed approach is the acquisition of the \""memory\"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home"",""1"",1166,125]]",0,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,no,0,11.103,1077,2114,bad,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183703064\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors"",""1"",453,120]]",0,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,yes,1,4.2989999999999995,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,no,0,5.603,1077,2114,good,1

Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183787993\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, "",""1"",662,165]]",0,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,no,0,2.46,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176150652\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users.

2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541167511013\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables."",""1"",508,208]]",1,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,yes,1,5.541,1077,2114,good,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,no,0,4.957,1077,2114,good,1

We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall.

2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183395961\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness.

2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460519284\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people."",""1"",25,143]]",0,False,9feaac7a50c59ebe2b586d868b425d7279a3b524,VEN,no,0,3.49,1077,2114,bad,1
2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183598079\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Physical function"",""1"",25,17],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183600697\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""older adults "",""3"",102,13],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183608545\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""physical and mental health-related"",""5"",287,34],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183621828\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" mental health-related factors"",""7"",1602,30]]",0,True,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,no,0,36.6,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508684292\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years."",""1"",504,92]]",0,True,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,no,0,34.145,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province.

The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014).

Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459500985\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology."",""1"",1752,284]]",1,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,yes,1,63.558,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,no,0,92.48299999999999,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460229865\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded."",""1"",1835,115]]",1,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,yes,1,23.052,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460602845\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets."",""1"",355,179],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460612084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general."",""3"",128,77]]",0,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,yes,1,51.563,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459976593\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers"",""1"",22,127]]",1,True,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,yes,1,68.218,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541165757323\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information."",""1"",1492,260]]",0,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,yes,1,16.430999999999997,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460133627\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors.

2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460188173\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions."",""1"",446,252]]",1,True,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,yes,1,24.182,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall. Using mobile devices to collect data from and monitor older adult patients has the potential to improve detection of changes in their health.",long,2175,325,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458707700\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires."",""1"",230,182],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458714659\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment"",""3"",166,129]]",0,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,no,0,91.212,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541184922051\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1)"",""1"",668,205]]",0,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,no,0,55.718,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access.

2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458460360\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients."",""1"",25,174]]",0,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,no,0,37.183,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample.

2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,5,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541167511013\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables."",""1"",508,208]]",1,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,yes,1,34.571,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,no,0,115.66799999999999,657,1349,good,1

The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541182900509\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan.

2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459388260\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia."",""1"",977,80]]",0,False,2f32e3f384c4b6b3882db67700ed408c84d9dbb1,HRV,no,0,120.669,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,6,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176084067\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions"",""1"",26,71],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176092826\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""OBJECTIVE.

2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,369217a9fd9c787acb4fde5c2f5cc15225cc019a,VEN,no,0,17.684,853,1730,good,1
2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making.

2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459624682\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,5d35d46f1c2ff41fd56067a3b8495f99cad481fe,VEN,no,0,33.673,657,1343,good,1

2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,5d35d46f1c2ff41fd56067a3b8495f99cad481fe,VEN,yes,1,12.047,657,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,41c617aaa245e6cc51eb168196500f944f721d9f,VEN,yes,1,4.952,848,1799,good,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459650215\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives"",""1"",194,98]]",0,True,41c617aaa245e6cc51eb168196500f944f721d9f,VEN,no,0,8.19,848,1799,bad,1
2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541182443521\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""he core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1).

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,e0ba72ad00ca1d2ae15c3d74586cd234e74577c0,BRA,no,0,1.454,937,1903,,1

Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01). Conclusions: Using the Internet may be beneficial for decreasing loneliness and increasing social contact among older adults in assisted and independent living communities.",long,2230,330,1349655,1,base,,1,True,e0ba72ad00ca1d2ae15c3d74586cd234e74577c0,BRA,yes,1,31.737,937,1903,,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,base,,1,True,e0ba72ad00ca1d2ae15c3d74586cd234e74577c0,BRA,yes,1,23.802,937,1903,,1
2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,base,,0,True,e0ba72ad00ca1d2ae15c3d74586cd234e74577c0,BRA,yes,1,19.059,937,1903,,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,df2cf70ac624ab6d1152a85125dd025522c7758c,VEN,no,0,24.236,986,2024,good,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459624682\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design.

2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541182443521\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""he core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1).

2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501070698\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control."",""1"",723,82],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501031791\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform"",""3"",179,102],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501040859\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list."",""5"",45,89]]",1,True,df2cf70ac624ab6d1152a85125dd025522c7758c,VEN,yes,1,27.615,986,2024,good,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,df2cf70ac624ab6d1152a85125dd025522c7758c,VEN,yes,1,6.617999999999999,986,2024,good,1
2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175865171\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey"",""1"",398,141],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175875491\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge."",""3"",262,266],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175888458\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459500985\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology."",""1"",1752,284]]",1,False,df2cf70ac624ab6d1152a85125dd025522c7758c,VEN,yes,1,5.337000000000001,986,2024,good,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,df2cf70ac624ab6d1152a85125dd025522c7758c,VEN,no,0,11.942,986,2024,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177094338\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones."",""1"",642,226]]",1,False,df2cf70ac624ab6d1152a85125dd025522c7758c,VEN,yes,1,24.226999999999997,986,2024,good,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460662572\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data"",""1"",535,125]]",0,False,df2cf70ac624ab6d1152a85125dd025522c7758c,VEN,no,0,19.558,986,2024,bad,1
2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541165757323\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information."",""1"",1492,260]]",0,False,df2cf70ac624ab6d1152a85125dd025522c7758c,VEN,no,0,13.283,597,1226,good,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460133627\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors.

2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,base,,0,True,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,84.98100000000001,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01). Conclusions: Using the Internet may be beneficial for decreasing loneliness and increasing social contact among older adults in assisted and independent living communities.",long,2230,330,1349655,1,base,,1,True,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,yes,1,57.669,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,61.052,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,base,,1,True,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,yes,1,38.289,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,base,,0,True,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,30.701,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,2,base,,0,True,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,13.573,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,27.659000000000002,648,1024,,1

To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,base,,1,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,yes,1,54.122,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,base,,1,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,26.95,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,base,,1,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,yes,1,21.927,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,72.253,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,3,base,,1,True,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,yes,1,88.478,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews.

2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,3,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,64.264,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,3,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,100.42,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,4,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,38.611999999999995,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,4,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,yes,1,39.781,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,4,base,,1,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,yes,1,50.446999999999996,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,5,base,,0,True,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,21.819000000000003,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall. Using mobile devices to collect data from and monitor older adult patients has the potential to improve detection of changes in their health.",long,2175,325,1349655,5,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,64.547,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,5,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,yes,1,54.648,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,5,base,,0,False,f0406a97bb79c5bbc8cec50873f3c0a832e83b56,PHL,no,0,47.542,648,1024,,1
2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,base,,0,True,8cc1dfb056f2771f2c837041db52641d5eec2f23,VEN,no,0,16.335,626,1007,,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,8cc1dfb056f2771f2c837041db52641d5eec2f23,VEN,yes,1,39.19,626,1007,,1
2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,base,,1,True,8cc1dfb056f2771f2c837041db52641d5eec2f23,VEN,yes,1,138.06799999999998,626,1007,,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,base,,0,True,8cc1dfb056f2771f2c837041db52641d5eec2f23,VEN,yes,1,7.08,626,1007,,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. Contacting family is likely to be the best ""selling point"" of the Internet for older people.",long,2860,443,1349655,1,base,,1,True,8cc1dfb056f2771f2c837041db52641d5eec2f23,VEN,yes,1,10.545,626,1007,,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,base,,1,True,8cc1dfb056f2771f2c837041db52641d5eec2f23,VEN,yes,1,6.142,626,1007,,1
2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183598079\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Physical function"",""1"",25,17],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183600697\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""older adults "",""3"",102,13],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183608545\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""physical and mental health-related"",""5"",287,34],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183621828\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" mental health-related factors"",""7"",1602,30]]",0,True,5c96addc8b5782f2cf6143f68a0924d91980f77f,NGA,no,0,56.891999999999996,1308,2698,good,1
2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00).

2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making.

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022).

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,7d44cb5856a45215dfbb11637f1d38f1474158a1,TUR,no,0,41.746,986,1779,good,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users.

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,base,,0,True,5eeb4aebffa4a305d953e5ba3dc56e8b9d04f6b1,EGY,no,0,54.181999999999995,861,1579,,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,5eeb4aebffa4a305d953e5ba3dc56e8b9d04f6b1,EGY,no,0,62.683,861,1579,,1
2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,base,,1,True,5eeb4aebffa4a305d953e5ba3dc56e8b9d04f6b1,EGY,no,0,151.11700000000002,861,1579,,1
2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,base,,1,True,5eeb4aebffa4a305d953e5ba3dc56e8b9d04f6b1,EGY,no,0,235.051,861,1579,,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,1,base,,1,True,a8c1ceeb65660dd09a57ce4a9f0897f1fcab4033,EGY,yes,1,56.872,625,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,base,,1,True,a8c1ceeb65660dd09a57ce4a9f0897f1fcab4033,EGY,no,0,8.711,625,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,a8c1ceeb65660dd09a57ce4a9f0897f1fcab4033,EGY,yes,1,40.873000000000005,625,1349,,1

2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459925749\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner."",""1"",511,370]]",1,True,b72f641b229ce3234bf1af6d132c3d8135d86cac,VNM,yes,1,19.974,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries.

2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499867213\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Online"",""1"",326,6],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499877880\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients"",""3"",1744,98]]",0,True,b72f641b229ce3234bf1af6d132c3d8135d86cac,VNM,yes,1,3.9339999999999997,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,base,,0,True,9dfaf695cc8822cc333fab8be2feb7f9d3fa1616,ESP,no,0,84.867,835,1799,,1
2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,base,,0,True,9dfaf695cc8822cc333fab8be2feb7f9d3fa1616,ESP,no,0,83.679,835,1799,,1

Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,2,base,,1,True,9dfaf695cc8822cc333fab8be2feb7f9d3fa1616,ESP,yes,1,64.998,835,1799,,1
2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,2,base,,1,False,9dfaf695cc8822cc333fab8be2feb7f9d3fa1616,ESP,yes,1,11.173,835,1799,,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support. Further research into online peer support for carers of people with dementia is needed to clarify who benefits under what conditions.",long,2243,325,1349655,2,base,,1,False,9dfaf695cc8822cc333fab8be2feb7f9d3fa1616,ESP,yes,1,21.366999999999997,835,1799,,1
2-s2.0-84903162147,"Computer-assisted direct observation of behavioral agitation, engagement, and affect in long-term care residents","Objectives: The objectives of the current research were (1) to test and evaluate the investigator-designed Behavior, Engagement, and Affect Measure (BEAM) touchpad direct observational data collection tool, and (2) to implement this tool to investigate residents' patterns of behavioral agitation, engagement, affect, behaviors associated with positive mood, general time-activity use, and social interactions within long-term care. Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,2,base,,0,False,9dfaf695cc8822cc333fab8be2feb7f9d3fa1616,ESP,yes,1,37.535,835,1799,,1
2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,2,base,,0,False,9dfaf695cc8822cc333fab8be2feb7f9d3fa1616,ESP,yes,1,41.173,835,1799,,1
2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541504673084\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions."",""1"",435,373]]",0,True,38c5437cf97035e8012527c9a65a9842d3b73c52,VEN,no,0,22.33,658,1309,good,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183027426\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment"",""1"",1548,110]]",1,True,38c5437cf97035e8012527c9a65a9842d3b73c52,VEN,maybe,1,20.006,658,1309,good,1
2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,38c5437cf97035e8012527c9a65a9842d3b73c52,VEN,no,0,42.577,658,1309,good,1
2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,base,,0,True,7a590b40cb0a63efacb78437071d7d025a4c8cee,BIH,yes,1,36.287,654,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,base,,0,True,7a590b40cb0a63efacb78437071d7d025a4c8cee,BIH,yes,1,17.49,654,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,7a590b40cb0a63efacb78437071d7d025a4c8cee,BIH,yes,1,60.659,654,1349,,1
2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,base,,1,True,7a590b40cb0a63efacb78437071d7d025a4c8cee,BIH,yes,1,52.769,654,1349,,1

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,198.135,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,1.3519999999999999,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501070698\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control."",""1"",723,82],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501031791\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform"",""3"",179,102],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541501040859\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list."",""5"",45,89]]",1,True,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,yes,1,2.145,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183688329\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""merging ICT technology"",""1"",23,22],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183692249\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""by older people"",""3"",43,15],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183698377\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Life-Based Design "",""5"",1263,18],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183702810\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""QoL"",""7"",592,3],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183708859\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes"",""9"",262,65],[""<span style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183716667\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Fit-for-life analysis"",""11"",110,21]]",0,True,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,6.843999999999999,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84862164688,Attitudes towards knowledge transfer in an environment to perform,"Purpose - This paper seeks to determine attitudes that impact on knowledge transfer between academics (university teaching and research staff) employed in today's competitive, technology-based university setting. Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",long,2306,335,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175865171\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey"",""1"",398,141],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175875491\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge."",""3"",262,266],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175888458\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459500985\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology."",""1"",1752,284]]",1,False,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,2.537,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,1.661,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177094338\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones."",""1"",642,226]]",1,False,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,8.812000000000001,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460662572\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data"",""1"",535,125]]",0,False,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,2.77,835,1343,bad,1
2-s2.0-84950127421,ICT-based system to predict and prevent falls (iStoppFalls): Results from an international multicenter randomized controlled trial,"Background: Falls and fall-related injuries are a serious public health issue. Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183787993\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, "",""1"",662,165]]",0,False,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,1.419,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176150652\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users.

2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460700482\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet"",""1"",508,126],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460736724\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Respondents in Cluster 4, the \""social users,\"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites."",""3"",1198,153]]",1,False,2c9f703382df3698e13a7101e27200ef38322f14,TUR,no,0,1.496,835,1343,good,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04).

2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183051342\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated.

2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,4,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176264504\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Random sample of patients aged 65 + years.

2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-77949355837,Physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in community dwelling older adults: A cross sectional study,"Background. Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",long,2210,333,1349655,1,base,,0,True,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,no,0,17.680999999999997,1524,980,,1

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province.

The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014).

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,no,0,47.071999999999996,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,base,,1,True,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,23.805999999999997,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,base,,1,True,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,16.374000000000002,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,2,base,,0,True,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,no,0,7.166,1524,980,,1

Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,2,base,,0,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,no,0,5.152,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,2,base,,0,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,7.024,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,2,base,,1,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,4.978,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,3,base,,0,True,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,no,0,12.619000000000002,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-79960442859,Objective measurement of sociability and activity: Mobile sensing in the community,"PURPOSE Automated systems able to infer detailed measures of a person's social interactions and physical activities in their natural environments could lead to better understanding of factors infl uencing well-being. We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04). CONCLUSIONS Mobile sensing of sociability and activity is well correlated with traditional measures and less prone to biases associated with questionnaires that rely on recall. Using mobile devices to collect data from and monitor older adult patients has the potential to improve detection of changes in their health.",long,2175,325,1349655,3,base,,0,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,5.864,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform. The authors would like to thank Gina Bufton, Hsu-Wen Huang, and Mitch Meltzer for the contributions to the material collection and characteristic coding of Facebook profile photographs.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,3,base,,0,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,no,0,4.316,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,3,base,,0,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,4.346,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

2-s2.0-84883400599,Internet use frequency and patient-centered care: Measuring patient preferences for participation using the health information wants questionnaire,"Background: The Internet is bringing fundamental changes to medical practice through improved access to health information and participation in decision making. However, patient preferences for participation in health care vary greatly. Promoting patient-centered health care requires an understanding of the relationship between Internet use and a broader range of preferences for participation than previously measured. Objective: To explore (1) whether there is a significant relationship between Internet use frequency and patients' overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, and (2) whether the relationships between Internet use frequency and information and decision-making preferences differ with respect to different aspects of health conditions. Methods: The Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ) was administered to gather data about patients' preferences for the (1) amount of information desired about different aspects of a health condition, and (2) level of decision-making autonomy desired across those same aspects. Results: The study sample included 438 individuals: 226 undergraduates (mean age 20; SD 2.15) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72; SD 9.00). A significant difference was found between the younger and older age groups' Internet use frequencies, with the younger age group having significantly more frequent Internet use than the older age group (younger age group mean 5.98, SD 0.33; older age group mean 3.50, SD 2.00; t436=17.42, P<.01). Internet use frequency was positively related to the overall preference rating (γ=.15, P<.05), suggesting that frequent Internet users preferred significantly more information and decision making than infrequent Internet users. The relationships between Internet use frequency and different types of preferences varied: compared with infrequent Internet users, frequent Internet users preferred more information but less decision making for diagnosis (γ=.57, P<.01); more information and more decision-making autonomy for laboratory test (γ=.15, P<.05), complementary and alternative medicine (γ=.32, P<.01), and self-care (γ=.15, P<.05); and less information but more decision-making autonomy for the psychosocial (γ=-.51, P<.01) and health care provider (γ=-.27, P<.05) aspects. No significant difference was found between frequent and infrequent Internet users in their preferences for treatment information and decision making. Conclusions: Internet use frequency has a positive relationship with the overall preferences for obtaining health information and decision-making autonomy, but its relationship with different types of preferences varies. These findings have important implications for medical practice. © Bo Xie, Mo Wang, Robert Feldman, Le Zhou.",long,2798,379,1349655,4,base,,0,True,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,1.807,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,4,base,,1,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,2.148,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support. Further research into online peer support for carers of people with dementia is needed to clarify who benefits under what conditions.",long,2243,325,1349655,4,base,,1,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,2.3169999999999997,1524,980,,1

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,4,base,,0,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,yes,1,2.987,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,4,base,,0,False,452af737b508a4184576b2b535671cfd916d7c56,EGY,no,0,3.2119999999999997,1524,980,,1
2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,base,,0,True,cea967ab375c770248a299629dde14a3c1b9bf4d,VNM,yes,1,37.629,938,1903,,1

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,base,,1,True,cea967ab375c770248a299629dde14a3c1b9bf4d,VNM,no,0,84.12899999999999,938,1903,,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,base,,0,True,cea967ab375c770248a299629dde14a3c1b9bf4d,VNM,no,0,38.131,938,1903,,1

Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175842217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information"",""1"",25,244]]",1,True,d7e2cb714d9a574a2e649a540489e21ed41fbf1e,EGY,no,0,147.342,947,1896,bad,1
2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177403852\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction."",""1"",824,195]]",1,True,d7e2cb714d9a574a2e649a540489e21ed41fbf1e,EGY,yes,1,64.265,947,1896,good,1
2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology. Older adults who used the Internet for email/texting purposes only were the most socially and economically disadvantaged group of Internet users.

We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04).

2-s2.0-84880582014,Cultural influences on Facebook photographs,"Prior research in social psychology indicates that East Asians from collectivistic and interdependent sociocultural systems are more sensitive to contextual information than Westerners, whereas Westerners with individualistic and independent representation have a tendency to process focal and discrete attributes of the environment. Here we have demonstrated that such systematic cultural variations can also be observed in cyberspace, focusing on self-presentation of photographs on Facebook, the most popular worldwide online social network site. We examined cultural differences in face/frame ratios for Facebook profile photographs in two studies. For Study 1, 200 digital profile face photographs of active Facebook users were randomly selected from native and immigrant Taiwanese and Americans. For Study 2, 312 Facebook profiles of undergraduate students of six public universities in East Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan) and the United States (California and Texas) were randomly selected. Overall, the two studies clearly showed that East Asian Facebook users are more likely to deemphasize their faces compared to Americans. Specifically, East Asians living in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan exhibited a predilection for context inclusiveness in their profile photographs, whereas Americans tended to prioritize their focal face at the expense of the background. Moreover, East Asian Facebook users had lower intensity of facial expression than Americans on their photographs. These results demonstrate marked cultural differences in context-inclusive styles versus object-focused styles between East Asian and American Facebook users. Our findings extend previous findings from the real world to cyberspace, and provide a novel approach to investigate cognition and behaviors across cultures by using Facebook as a data collection platform.

2-s2.0-84929406209,A framework of an always-with companion agent for the isolated elderly,"Purpose: With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated. If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",long,2453,381,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183051342\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""With advances in medical technology, many older adults find themselves feeling isolated.

2-s2.0-85016103168,"Promoting independence, health and well-being for older people: A feasibility study of computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care","Background: With population ageing, research is needed into new low-cost, scalable methods of effective promotion of health and wellbeing for older people. We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",long,2598,353,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176264504\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Random sample of patients aged 65 + years.

2-s2.0-85019661194,Rehabilitation and psychosocial determinants of cochlear implant outcomes in older adults,"Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) has been shown to be associated with better hearing, cognitive abilities, and functional independence. There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508684292\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years."",""1"",504,92]]",0,True,d7e2cb714d9a574a2e649a540489e21ed41fbf1e,EGY,no,0,63.416000000000004,947,1896,bad,1
2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183239367\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life"",""1"",364,96]]",1,False,d7e2cb714d9a574a2e649a540489e21ed41fbf1e,EGY,yes,1,7.225,947,1896,good,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",long,2525,324,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183638147\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""conducted semistructured interviews"",""1"",510,35],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183656977\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""esearchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care.

2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,3,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176084067\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"","" Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions"",""1"",26,71],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176092826\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""OBJECTIVE.

2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-84878728077,"Internet use among older adults: Association with health needs, psychological capital, and social capital","Background: Previous studies have identified socioeconomic status and health status as predictors of older adults' computer and Internet use, but researchers have not examined the relationships between older adults' health needs and psychological capital (emotional well-being and self-efficacy) and social capital (social integration/ties and support networks) to different types of Internet use. Objective: This study examined (1) whether older adults' health conditions and psychological and social capital differentiate Internet users from nonusers, and (2) whether the Internet users differed in their types of Internet use on the basis of their health conditions and psychological and social capital. Methods: Data for this study came from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which is based on a nationally representative sample of US Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. The sample for this study were those who resided in the community in their own or others' homes (N=6680). Binary logistic regression analysis was used to compare health needs, psychological capital, and social capital among (1) any type of Internet users and nonusers, (2) Internet users who engaged in health-related tasks and Internet users who did not, (3) Internet users who engaged in shopping/banking tasks and Internet users who did not, and (4) Internet users only used the Internet for email/texting and all other Internet users. Results: Depressive and anxiety symptoms, measures of psychological capital, were negatively associated with Internet use among older adults (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98, P=.03 and OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.97, P=.03, respectively), whereas most measures of social capital were positively associated with Internet use. Having more chronic medical conditions and engaging in formal volunteering increased the odds of Internet use for health-related tasks by 1.15 (95% CI 1.08-1.23, P<.001) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.05-1.57, P=.02), respectively, but anxiety symptoms decreased the odds (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55-0.99, P=.05). Religious service attendance was negatively associated with Internet use for shopping/banking activities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P=.01). Anxiety symptoms increased the odds of using the Internet only for emails/texting (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.12-2.75, P=.02), but formal volunteering decreased the odds (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.43-0.92, P=.02). Other correlates of Internet use solely for emails/texting were older age (80-84 years and ≥85 years), a black or ""other"" racial/ethnic background, a high school education or less than high school, and lower income. Conclusions: The findings point to the importance of social capital in facilitating older adults' learning and adoption of Internet technology.

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,base,,0,True,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,22.730999999999998,657,1349,,1

This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,base,,0,True,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,no,0,37.361,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84945962016,Smart remote control design for seniors,"Technology is present in almost all aspects of our modern lives, and technological advances have been more and more prevalent. One would expect this to facilitate everybody’s life, rendering common tasks more practical and easier to perform, but that is often not the case - at least not for the elderly. Older people have significant difficulties in using technological equipment due to the visual, physical, cognitive and hearing limitations associated with the natural aging process; these aspects must be taken into account if the intention is that of integrating technology in the lives of the elderly. In order to improve the quality of life of the elderly, as well as to prevent their social isolation, a mobile device application was developed to act as an intelligent remote control. This mobile application deals with data from two different platforms that were previously developed for improving the quality of life of the senior population: HbbTV and +Social. The features built into this virtual remote control include the integration with the +Social platform, as well as a speech recognition mechanism, and the possibility of making and receiving video calls with an integrated contacts list. A comprehensive study was carried out, focusing on recommendations and rules for graphical interfaces for the elderly, so as to allow equipping the application with adequate usability standards. The most relevant result was the definition of a list of guidelines used to steer the development of the interface. An investigation of mechanisms and technologies for enabling the implementation of the required functionalities was also carried out in order to define methodologies for freeing the user from the need of possessing any level of computer literacy. A series of usability tests was also performed to validate the viability of the remote control application. These tests allowed assessing the quality of the application, especially concerning the Graphical User Interface, as well as to receive feedback from potential end users. Based on the data collected during the test phase we conclude that this product is useful and that it responds to a current need. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",long,2228,348,1349655,1,base,,1,True,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,12.294,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-84929417329,Creation of a 'Caricature Robot' for social inclusion of older adults,"Purpose: Communication and social participation for older adults has become an increasingly important need within an aging society. Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,2,base,,1,True,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,20.796,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84865506640,The effects of CareTV on feelings of loneliness and safety in frail elderly,"Objective: With the increase in life expectancy and growth in the number of frail elderly, the demand for complex care will increase. In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84893864978,Combatting social isolation and cognitive decline: Play a physical or digital game?,"Two significant problems among the elderly community are those of social isolation and the cognitive decline that occurs as we age. These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",long,2272,356,1349655,2,base,,1,False,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,14.727,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84903454175,Toward a companion agent for the elderly - The methods to estimate at-home and outside-home daily life activities of the elderly who live alone,"With advances in medical technology, people's life have been extended, and there are more and more older adults isolated. If they do not maintain social life with others, they may feel loneliness and anxiety. For their mental health, it is reported effective to keep their social relationship with others, for example, the conversation with their caregivers or other elderly people. Active listening is a communication technique that the volunteer listener listens to the speaker (the elderly) carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This helps to make the elderly feel cared and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project aiming to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who is always with the user and can engage active listening to maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users. In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user for a longer period, we believe that it is essential to make the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work. The proposed approach is the acquisition of the ""memory"" of the user's daily life in two situations, at-home and outside-home. In the former one, multiple Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were adopted. The depth information is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outside-home configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. Both the at-home and outside-home activity estimation methods have been developed and have been evaluated in a laboratory environment with student subjects at a moderate accuracy. The interface of the companion agent is being designed with the results from human-human and human-agent (driven by the data from the human listener condition) subject experiments. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiment with elderly subjects in near future. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",long,2416,373,1349655,2,base,,0,False,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,35.413000000000004,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84929411059,Transform silver elderly to gold resources,"Purpose: A demographically aging population is one of the several factors creating great pressure and future challenges in China. The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",long,3840,599,1349655,2,base,,0,False,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,2.4459999999999997,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84959193555,Older Adults' Reasons for Using Technology while Aging in Place,"Background: Most older adults prefer to age in place, and supporting older adults to remain in their own homes and communities is also favored by policy makers. Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S.

2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",long,3119,469,1349655,3,base,,1,True,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,3.0389999999999997,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,3,base,,0,False,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,no,0,23.695999999999998,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,3,base,,0,False,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,19.699,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,3,base,,1,False,97252d47dfd0c5fc8745d9cf9825e5894fcf0be0,VNM,yes,1,4.55,657,1349,,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,616ecacaec52dfad4a07dbb28b87ffef1c6361b8,VEN,no,0,30.324,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84877312145,Impact of internet use on loneliness and contact with others among older adults: Cross-sectional analysis,"Background: Older adults are at increased risk of experiencing loneliness and depression, particularly as they move into different types of care communities. Information and communication technology (ICT) usage may help older adults to maintain contact with social ties. However, prior research is not consistent about whether ICT use increases or decreases isolation and loneliness among older adults. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine how Internet use affects perceived social isolation and loneliness of older adults in assisted and independent living communities. We also examined the perceptions of how Internet use affects communication and social interaction. Methods: One wave of data from an ongoing study of ICT usage among older adults in assisted and independent living communities in Alabama was used. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between frequency of going online and isolation and loneliness (n=205) and perceptions of the effects of Internet use on communication and social interaction (n=60). Results: After controlling for the number of friends and family, physical/emotional social limitations, age, and study arm, a 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with a 0.147-point decrease in loneliness scores (P=.005). Going online was not associated with perceived social isolation (P=.14). Among the measures of perception of the social effects of the Internet, each 1-point increase in the frequency of going online was associated with an increase in agreement that using the Internet had: (1) made it easier to reach people (b=0.508, P<.001), (2) contributed to the ability to stay in touch (b=0.516, P<.001), (3) made it easier to meet new people (b=0.297, P=.01, (4) increased the quantity of communication with others (b=0.306, P=.01), (5) made the respondent feel less isolated (b=0.491, P<.001), (6) helped the respondent feel more connected to friends and family (b=0.392, P=.001), and (7) increased the quality of communication with others (b=0.289, P=.01).

2-s2.0-84929406561,The demand for ecotourism based on age group with the changes of social structure for age groups and the importance of tourism,"Purpose: The market for tourism by aging adults is increasing. In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",long,3240,509,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176879597\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism."",""1"",2991,262]]",0,True,616ecacaec52dfad4a07dbb28b87ffef1c6361b8,VEN,no,0,40.28,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,616ecacaec52dfad4a07dbb28b87ffef1c6361b8,VEN,no,0,39.385,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84938563749,Web-enabled conversational interactions as a method to improve cognitive functions: Results of a 6-week randomized controlled trial,"Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment.

2-s2.0-84921647901,Cyberseniors and quality of life: A focus on social networking,"In the contemporary world which emphasizes the new, the different and the snapshot, we perceive an inversion of roles with regard to stages of life and appreciation of individuals. The old age in Western societies has often been linked to inactivity and biological decline. To reinforce this thought we find the cult of youth which dominates media, advertising and the contemporary society (Brandão and Silveira, 2010). Aging is not only a question of genetics and biology, but also psychological and social issues. Aging is a natural development of life and depends on the environmental conditions and the socio-cultural characteristics of seniors' lives (Freitas, 2011). Nowadays the information and communication technologies (ICT) have contributed to dissemination of knowledge through several means, and to do so ICT use digital tools. These tools allow not only research but also may provide conditions towards knowledge to be shared and socialized. Thus, these technologies may help older people to reduce isolation and loneliness, increasing their chances of keeping in touch with family and friends, including their social relationships through the use of social networks as a tool to facilitate the active aging achievement (Páscoa, 2012). In this sense the population is increasingly concerned about the quality of life. Quality of life encompasses different factors and therefore it is considered multidimensional. So, quality of life refers about biological, educational, psychological and social aspects which include new changes in society. The use of ICTs can help seniors to enjoy and include themselves in the Knowledge Society, mostly through Digital Social Networks (DSN) where they can relate with family and friends. The Digital Social Networks (DSN) foster changes in social relationships and they are a medium that enable changes in social relations, this research aims to investigate the influence of the use of DSN by elderly who are already digitally included and utilize this type of technology. We investigated the DSN influence in the quality of life of seniors. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with twelve seniors who participated in a course of digital inclusion in Brazil, during 2009 to 2013. We used the WHOQOL-bref Questionnaire of World Health Organization to evaluate the quality of life perceived by the participants. Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones. This shows that DSN can improve the quality of life for seniors.",long,2644,411,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541167669350\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Our findings indicate that seniors were active participants in the DSN, and use it mainly to communicate with each other and exchange information as a way to maintain existing relationships and to obtain new ones."",""1"",2379,213]]",1,False,616ecacaec52dfad4a07dbb28b87ffef1c6361b8,VEN,yes,1,11.787,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84928566433,Attitudes towards the use and acceptance of eHealth technologies: A case study of older adults living with chronic pain and implications for rural healthcare,"Background: Providing health services to an ageing population is challenging, and in rural areas even more so. It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",long,2212,330,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459546234\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments."",""1"",407,192],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459553688\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare"",""3"",235,155],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459561711\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain"",""5"",503,91]]",1,False,616ecacaec52dfad4a07dbb28b87ffef1c6361b8,VEN,no,0,99.48100000000001,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-84929417715,Smartphone use by older adults in Singapore,"Purpose: The unprecedented penetration of smartphones into the Singapore market offers potentially cost-effective and sustainable solutions for people to stay connected with their families, friends and communities. However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",long,3550,545,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175959107\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone"",""1"",904,63],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175953443\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model "",""3"",363,52],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175939963\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures"",""5"",1459,228]]",1,False,616ecacaec52dfad4a07dbb28b87ffef1c6361b8,VEN,yes,1,3.4189999999999996,657,1349,good,1
2-s2.0-85030531151,Older adults perceptions of technology and barriers to interacting with tablet computers: A focus group study,"Background: New technologies provide opportunities for the delivery of broad, flexible interventions with older adults. Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",long,2221,312,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460662572\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data"",""1"",535,125]]",0,False,616ecacaec52dfad4a07dbb28b87ffef1c6361b8,VEN,yes,1,7.42,657,1349,bad,1
2-s2.0-84865446863,Early detection of dementia and ICT: Signs from practice,"Objective and research questions. Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

The United Nations found Thai elderly population were increased rapidly compared with other developing countries. Global estimations of the burden of disease show that mental illness plays a prominent role. Elderly club is one of the several ways to promote social interaction, gain self esteem, slow progression of physical and mental disabilities in old age people. However, the activities which certainly proper for each elderly group remains unclear because various demographic data background of elderly in each area. To determine the mental health status, including depression and quality of life among members of the Thammasat hospital elderly club which covers elderly members in northen Bangkok, Pathumthani and Ayutthaya province. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Seventy members were sampled for interview from 207 members. The assessment tools were Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-54), Thai Geriatric Depression Scale (TGDS), Stress self assessment questionnaire, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-Brief-Thai Version (WHOQOL-BREF-THAI). The majority of the sample was females (78.6%). The age ranged from 60 to 84 years old (mean 70.24). The prevalences of psychological problems were; poor mental health (12.90%), depression (5.7%) and stress (15.2%). The sample reported poorer quality of life on 3 sub-domains of WHOQOL; physical (2.9%), psychological (1.4%) and social relationship (4.30%) domains. The level of depression, reported by those who had not enough income, was significantly higher than those who had enough income (p = 0.022). Quality of life (physical and social relationship domain) among those aged younger than 70 years, was better than that among those aged 70 or older (p = 0.024 and p = 0.023 respectively). Quality of life (psychological domain) among those who had not enough income, was significantly poorer than those with enough income (p = 0.020). Quality of life in term of social relationship was better among those living in urban areas (p = 0.037) or having better education (p = 0.014).

2-s2.0-84887957045,Participatory design with seniors: Design of future services and iterative refinements of interactive eHealth services for old citizens,"Background: There is an increasing social isolation among the elderly today. This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",long,3032,466,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176786378\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen.

2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",long,2910,450,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460188173\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions."",""1"",446,252]]",1,True,c89f0531b1d57ef47a715ff3f01ec55f537f2457,VEN,yes,1,4.974,1089,1684,good,1
2-s2.0-84982883886,"Cognitive–behavioural therapy-based intervention to reduce fear of falling in older people: Therapy development and randomised controlled trial – the strategies for increasing independence, confidence and energy (STRIDE) study","Background Falls cause fear, anxiety and loss of confidence, resulting in activity avoidance, social isolation and increasing frailty. The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,c89f0531b1d57ef47a715ff3f01ec55f537f2457,VEN,no,0,,1089,1684,good,1
2-s2.0-26444489161,Design and pilot results of a single blind randomized controlled trial of systematic demand-led home visits by nurses to frail elderly persons in primary care [ISRCTN05358495],"Background: The objective of this article is to describe the design of an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of systematic home visits by nurses to frail elderly primary care patients. Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",long,2284,338,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541458490368\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses."",""1"",1870,127]]",0,False,c89f0531b1d57ef47a715ff3f01ec55f537f2457,VEN,no,0,,1089,1684,bad,1
2-s2.0-84959018208,Case management promotion of social media for the elderly who live alone,"Purpose: Professional case managers advocate patient access to necessary and appropriate services, while educating the patient and family and/or caregiver about resource availability within practice settings. The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2-s2.0-84989885205,Being an informed consumer of health information and assessment of electronic health literacy in a national sample of internet users: Validity and reliability of the e-HLS instrument,"Background: The Internet, with its capacity to provide information that transcends time and space barriers, continues to transform how people find and apply information to their own lives. With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",long,3113,449,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176150652\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users.

2-s2.0-85031091663,Diversity in Older Adults' Use of the Internet: Identifying Subgroups Through Latent Class Analysis,"BACKGROUND: As for all individuals, the Internet is important in the everyday life of older adults. Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",long,2892,431,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460700482\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet"",""1"",508,126],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460736724\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Respondents in Cluster 4, the \""social users,\"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites."",""3"",1198,153]]",1,False,c89f0531b1d57ef47a715ff3f01ec55f537f2457,VEN,yes,1,4.322,1089,1684,good,1
2-s2.0-85040464379,The effectiveness of a web 2.0 physical activity intervention in older adults - a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Interactive web-based physical activity interventions using Web 2.0 features (e.g., social networking) have the potential to improve engagement and effectiveness compared to static Web 1.0 interventions. However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506611725\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults"",""1"",22,96],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506626896\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms"",""3"",162,93],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541506599049\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity."",""5"",1647,135]]",0,True,b0c84f1ed26c5d8f08e39438485a40e1c8390ba0,VEN,no,0,66.172,760,1615,good,1
2-s2.0-84929391390,Fit-for-life of future emerging technology,"Purpose: Emerging ICT technology is often viewed as obscure and unpleasant by older people1. In addition, it is associated with a variety of ethical considerations2. In many cases, older people find it difficult to imagine a role for modern ICT technology in their everyday lives, since technology of this kind does not necessarily fit in with the forms of life of this target group. This is most often due to the failure of ICT design paradigms to address the issues involved in living a good life. Traditionally, the core user challenge in ICT design has been associated with the immediate usage situation. Human-centred approaches such as contextual design, scenario-based design, and design with personas strive to design technology based on an investigation of what people could do with a given technology and how they actually use it. However, to ensure that products and services fit in with people's goals, it is imperative that we ask why people would adopt and use a certain technology in their lives. An analysis of people's lives (and personal characteristics) and living conditions is necessary in order to answer this question. In addition, clear conceptualisations and methodological models are required in order to describe how such knowledge of technology design processes might be applied. A model for a multi-dimensional and holistic Life-Based Design (LBD) has been introduced on these grounds3,4. This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design. Method: Part of LBD consists of a fit-for-life analysis, which examines the benefits and meaningfulness people can derive from the solutions developed, as well as the impact that such solutions can have on everyday life. It illustrates the logic involved in enhancing quality of life (QoL), presupposing a thorough understanding of the concept and content of QoL, particularly the reassessment of QoL parameters in relation to everyday life supported by technology. When designing for quality of life, it is necessary to understand what is relevant to people's values. Fit-for-life analysis thus includes an analysis of the relevant biological, psychological, and socio-cultural attributes of forms of life, and examines the ethical problems that may be created by technology. Results & Discussion: Fit-for-life analysis calls for a clarification of the issue of according to whose perspectives technology can contribute yielding higher value in improving quality of life. The outcome could lead to improvements in and modifications of product ideas. Technology is empowering when designed to be fit for the lives of older people. For example, it can enhance capabilities and self-efficacy and promote a feeling of security and ability to cope with life, while preventing loneliness and enabling participation in working life and social activities.",long,2952,461,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541459624682\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This approach emphasises analysis of the role of technology in human life: facts and values related to forms of life, as a basis for the creation of design ideas and for concept design.

2-s2.0-84929399216,Development of patient-centered home healthcare communication system,"Purpose: For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team. However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",long,3063,476,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541176699290\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""For effective home health care, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals must come together from various organizations, and they are required to work as a team"",""1"",22,171]]",1,True,b0c84f1ed26c5d8f08e39438485a40e1c8390ba0,VEN,no,0,20.065,760,1615,bad,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-84940639024,Long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a computer-tailored physical activity intervention among people aged over fifty: Modelling the results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Physical inactivity is a significant predictor of several chronic diseases, becoming more prevalent as people age. Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",long,2435,335,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541177247217\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty"",""1"",303,140]]",0,True,b0c84f1ed26c5d8f08e39438485a40e1c8390ba0,VEN,no,0,143.502,760,1615,good,1
2-s2.0-80054943781,"The sense of coherence (SOC) as an important determinant of life satisfaction, based on own research, and exemplified by the students of University of the Third Age (U3A)","The SOC is an important determinant of life satisfaction of elderly people. It determines the level of coping with various difficult situations, which accompany an old age stage. The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54 ± 6.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r= -0.375, p< 0.01) relation η= 0.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals' level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",long,2158,336,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508563612\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students."",""1"",192,121],[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541508599734\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires"",""3"",533,94]]",0,True,2e4e03ca40cee17881c5476f8866eb232b6e5018,GRC,no,0,148.548,754,1519,good,1

2-s2.0-84929402154,Care delivery frame: A home telehealth system based on social networking,"Purpose: Home telehealth systems generally focus on building connections between home environments and home telehealth service providers and place technical emphasis on establishing an information platform for health data transmission, storage, and analysis. Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking.

2-s2.0-84929676133,eHealth literacy and Web 2.0 health information seeking behaviors among baby boomers and older adults,"Background: Baby boomers and older adults, a subset of the population at high risk for chronic disease, social isolation, and poor health outcomes, are increasingly utilizing the Internet and social media (Web 2.0) to locate and evaluate health information. However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",long,3017,447,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541460317207\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information."",""1"",1389,158]]",1,True,2e4e03ca40cee17881c5476f8866eb232b6e5018,GRC,yes,1,13.055,754,1519,good,1

Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541499771538\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity"",""1"",118,197]]",0,True,2e4e03ca40cee17881c5476f8866eb232b6e5018,GRC,yes,1,14.225999999999999,754,1519,good,1
2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

2-s2.0-77958547430,Decent digital social media for senior life: A practical design approach,"This research is an anterior project of a pilot study for identifying factors that determine the adoption and usage of digital social network platform services by the elderly population in Taiwan. The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",long,2278,351,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541183239367\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life"",""1"",364,96]]",1,False,2e4e03ca40cee17881c5476f8866eb232b6e5018,GRC,yes,1,18.075,754,1519,good,1
2-s2.0-84897635686,The effectiveness of an internet support forum for carers of people with dementia: A pre-post cohort study,"Background: The well-being of informal carers of people with dementia is an important public health issue. Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum.

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine.

2-s2.0-84951961928,Web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing AIDS,"INTRODUCTION. Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",long,2739,418,1349655,2,83%,"[[""<span class=\""highlighted\"" data-timestamp=\""1541175809634\"" style=\""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 123);\"" data-highlighted=\""true\""></span>"",""To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids"",""1"",388,109]]",0,False,2e4e03ca40cee17881c5476f8866eb232b6e5018,GRC,yes,1,5.675,754,1519,good,1
2-s2.0-85033454755,Discontinued Information and Communication Technology Usage among Older Adults in Continuing Care Retirement Communities in the United States,"Background: Older adults are increasingly using information and communication technologies (ICTs). Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

2-s2.0-84862220084,A smart garment for active ageing: Mapping user requirements to technology,"Objective. Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

2-s2.0-84880120348,Community-acquired pneumonia: Symptoms and burden of illness at diagnosis among US adults aged 50 years and older,"Purpose: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, yet few studies have comprehensively measured the burden of CAP symptoms and their impact from the patient perspective. Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",long,2424,345,1349655,1,base,,0,True,cef3a34f9a192505c999a3879f815e20f161a15b,EGY,yes,1,30.514,1250,2014,,1
2-s2.0-84919807805,Younger and older users' recognition of virtual agent facial expressions,"As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent's social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent's facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2-s2.0-84930331694,Older people going online: Its value and before-After evaluation of volunteer support,"Although Internet usage can benefit older people by reducing social isolation, increasing access to services, and improving health and well-being, only a minority are online. Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health. Contacting family is likely to be the best ""selling point"" of the Internet for older people.",long,2860,443,1349655,1,base,,1,True,cef3a34f9a192505c999a3879f815e20f161a15b,EGY,yes,1,12.270999999999999,1250,2014,,1
2-s2.0-84988369473,Social and environmental predictors of walking among older adults,"Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is a major factor in maintaining health in aging populations. This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",long,2324,364,1349655,1,base,,0,True,cef3a34f9a192505c999a3879f815e20f161a15b,EGY,yes,1,22.256999999999998,1250,2014,,1
2-s2.0-85016997614,The interplay of physical and social wellbeing in older adults: Investigating the relationship between physical training and social interactions with virtual social environments,"Background. Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",long,2910,434,1349655,1,base,,1,True,cef3a34f9a192505c999a3879f815e20f161a15b,EGY,yes,1,13.448,1250,2014,,1
